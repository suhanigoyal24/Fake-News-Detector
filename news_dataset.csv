Sunday Special,"Ancient India was among the first to experiment with colours and dyed fabric was part of its prime exports. However, the west's fear of colours, India's colonial history and mindset, and the class bias associated with bright palettes are making India go colourless. Indians are taking to pastels, monochromes and neutral colours, for clothes, cars and buildings. Will Indians embrace their very own colours and make the dull world colourful? Before flying to the US, many travellers make a quick stop at small businesses in Mumbai and Ahmedabad to stock up on vacuum-sealed packets of thepla, fafda, ready-to-eat pav bhaji, and other Gujarati snacks. The Gujarati women who run these businesses from their home kitchens are a lifeline for students and techies going to the US. Their pre-ordered foods are especially for those travelling abroad. This is what happens after that first phone call reporting an explosion, just like in the Red Fort blast case in Delhi. Veterans tell us how central agencies, like the NSG and the NIA, the state police and the forensic science laboratories react and how the entire counter-terror operation is coordinated. Drones are being used for deliveries in Gurgaon and Bengaluru. Amazon is trying out AI automation at its warehouses. But the 12 million people in India's gig economy are oblivious of that. From millions of additions to the workforce to automation, India's gig economy is set for an upheaval. Will that be the end of the road for the millions who are always on the move but never move up? Just a Facebook like by Chef Sumit Kumar got him defrauded of Rs 38 lakh in an investment impersonation scam. Such scams have resulted in 30,000 people across major cities in India losing over Rs 1,500 crore in the last 6 months. Here's why people willingly hand over their hard-earned money to scammers, and how the cash becomes untraceable. Ever had cab drivers in Bengaluru answer your call in fluent corporate lingo? Chances are, they might have been techies. It's not just for the money. Software engineers are driving cabs to beat loneliness at home and drudgery at the office, revealing a problem in our corporate culture. Coconut prices have exploded across India, leaving households and hawkers equally stunned. The coconut crisis is reflected in crispy banana chips to everyday curries and chutneys. What's causing this steep surge, and how long will the naryial crunch last? Gujaratis own over 60% of motels in the US. But the killing of seven Gujaratis linked to the motel business this year reveals the occupational hazards. Motel owners from the US share how they have managed to run the dhandho successfully despite increasing gun violence and racism. Medical prescriptions that are nothing but scribbles and scrawls are very common. Bad handwriting of doctors is a problem faced regularly by patients and pharmacists, and recently saw a stern observation by a high court in a medico-legal case. Here's why doctors have bad handwriting and the way to fix illegible prescriptions. Immersion of idols on Vijayadashami caps Durga Puja celebrations every year. However, in Varanasi's Madanpura, it's the same clay idol that has been being worshipped for almost 260 years now. Legend has it that in 1767, the Durga idol at Bengali Tola refused to move when people tried to take it out for immersion. Indians find it difficult to kiss, and in India even Superman can't kiss in public. A simple Google search shows Indians trying to learn the art of the lip-lock. While India is referred to as the land of Kama Sutra on anything intimate or erotic, kissing was never part of the culture. But why has India, which has adopted and adapted both cultures and behaviours, failed to embrace the kiss? That Gen Z protesters toppled the Oli government in Nepal shouldn't be surprising. From Bhagat Singh to Che Guevara, the face of rebellions has almost always been the young. But why do the young rebel, and what is it that drives them to the streets? Once the ultimate ticket to the American Dream, the H-1B visa stands vilified now. As the Trump administration cracks down, Indians with H-1B and jobs are scared to go to the US. Social media shorts and Instagram Reels are creating dangerous friction in Indian society. The technology of the 21st century is clashing with the mores of a society still in the 19th century. While men opt for risky, women are getting into risque and vulgar content in an economy where eyeballs convert to hard cash. The Nikki Bhati case is just the tip of the iceberg. Here's how Indian society is reeling from the reel-making tornado. The ban on real-money online gaming is upending real lives. Thousands of professionals are desperately looking for jobs as their companies hit the dead end. The sector also sustained people earning from games of skills, like millions in India do from the stock market. This is the untold story of how the government's blanket ban on real money gaming platforms has hit lakhs of people. The debate over Delhi's stray dogs has split the nation. While pet dogs are trained and groomed, street dogs have an entirely different image. Unlike what is popularly believed, strays can be trained, and their aggression largely reduced. Behaviourists and trainers who have trained stray dogs tell us how. Armed to work remotely during the Covid lockdown, and unfettered after it, India's professionals got hooked on the nomadic way of life, travelling while earning their daily dal-roti. India now has a huge band of Digital Nomads who aren't moored in any city, and are constantly travelling from place to place while working. The British-origin Cavendish banana is invading markets across the world and has become the dominant variety sold everywhere. Even in India, Cavendish and its sub-varieties have gained territory, making native varieties like Bihar's Chinia and Assam's Bhimkol harder to spot. From Tamil Nadu to the Northeast, the native kadali phalams are putting up a tough fight. Will desi bananas be able to beat back the colonial Cavendish? Being declared HIV-positive was akin to a death sentence in India of the 1990s. With new medicines, lifespan is not an issue any more. And now, more and more HIV-positive individuals are getting married, and having healthy kids. Matrimonial sites have launched sections focused on HIV+ individuals. This is how science and activism have turned stigma into happily-ever-after stories. Legendary marathoner Fauja Singh, 114, was recently killed in a hit-and-run accident. Over 30,400 people were killed in such accidents in India in 2022. But why do people flee accident spots, leaving behind the victim? Fear of being lynched, a sense of impunity and little value for lives play a role. Police also categorise accidents as hit-and-run to avoid probing them. Can India, where corruption rules, bring down hit-and-run cases?",real,https://www.indiatoday.in,https://www.indiatoday.in/sunday-special
History of It,"Unlike Punjab or Bengal, where the Partition in 1947 gave parts to India and Pakistan, Sindh went completely to the Islamic nation. Its rivers, cities, and centuries of shared culture left behind and uprooted Sindhi Hindus from their homeland. Why isn't any part of Sindh, which finds mention in India's National Anthem, in India? While the post-World War 2 Nuremberg Trials of Europe are taught as part of history, nothing much is said about the Asian version—the Tokyo Trials. Also forgotten in India is the role played by Radhabinod Pal, the lone jurist among the 11 judges to dissent and seek the release of Japan's wartime Generals. Revisiting Pal's role in the Tokyo Trials as the world marks the 80th anniversary of the Nuremberg Trials, and is gripped by a Russel Crowe-starrer on it. Vande Mataram represents the soul of India's freedom struggle. However, its provocative use as a slogan at times made Mahatma Gandhi equate it with Allahu Akbar. Despite the opposition from a section of Muslims, Congress leaders knew there couldn't be a better National Song. It was Rabindranath Tagore who separated two stanzas from the six others, and endorsed it as the National Song. Pakistan, partitioned as an Islamic nation, stained its history shedding blood of Muslim Pathans within a year of its creation. On August 12, 1948, police forces in the regime of Muhammad Ali Jinnah slaughtered 600 Pathan or Pashtun followers of Frontier Gandhi Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan for trying to protest peacefully. Here's all about the Babrra Massacre, also referred to as the ""Karbala of the Pashtuns"". Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal, all of 21, blew up a series of Pakistani tanks before laying down his life for the country in the 1971 War. When Arun's father, Brigadier ML Khetarpal (Retd) visited Sargodha in 2001, he was hosted by a Pakistani soldier, Khwaja Mohammad Naser. Naser confessed that he was the one who pulled the tank trigger in 1971 that got his son killed. While Afghanistan and Pakistan were engaged in a war this month, an image showing an India-Afghanistan border pillar from the 1930s went viral. India and Afghanistan shared a small land border through the Wakhan Corridor before Pakistan wedged itself in through treachery and the illegal occupation of Gilgit-Baltistan in 1947. After Indira Gandhi's assassination, Rajiv Gandhi reportedly had a secret meeting with then RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras, resulting in its cadre supporting the Congress in the 1984 Lok Sabha elections despite the BJP's presence. There were at least six secret meetings between Sangh members and the party, including one at the residence of liquor baron Kapil Mohan. The Congress registered the biggest-ever Lok Sabha election victory. Pakistan minister Khawaja Asif said India was ""never truly united except under Aurangzeb"". Did the sixth Mughal emperor, under whom the dynasty reached the zenith of territorial dominance, indeed unify India? What's the historical fact? From the 1970 Black September in Jordan when Pakistani troops under Zia-Ul-Haq's command butchered 25,000 Palestinians, to the brand-new defence pact with Riyadh, Pakistan's generals have long fought for whoever signs the biggest cheques. The latest deal with Saudi Arabia, with a promise of a nuclear shield, is the latest chapter in Rawalpindi's long mercenary ledger. It was the bravery and military campaign of Zorawar Singh Kahluria, a General of Jammu king Gulab Singh, that first brought Ladakh into the Dogra fold in 1834. The sale of Jammu and Kashmir by the British to Gulab Singh in 1846, and his great-grandson Hari Singh's signing of the treaty of accession in 1947, made Ladakh an integral part of India. After its humiliating defeat to China in the 1962 war, India turned the tables just a few years later. In two little-known battles in 1967 at Nathu La and Cho La, fought weeks apart, Indian forces pushed back the Chinese and restored a measure of pride. Eighty-eight Indian bravehearts laid down their lives, but the toll on the Chinese side was over 300. This victory cemented India's hold over Sikkim, and shattered China's aura of invincibility. After Gen Z–led protests toppled the Oli government, Nepal once again finds itself in the grip of political turmoil and violence. Just over 15 years ago, Nepal, once the world's last Hindu kingdom, where monarchs were revered as living deities, was transformed by a Maoist-led uprising. Earlier this week, when speculation over Donald Trump's alleged death was swirling, the Pentagon Pizza Index surged by 800%. Pizza orders near the Pentagon—the headquarters of the US Defence Department—are considered a barometer, hinting at officials at work for hours, during a crunch situation. This was also the case in June when the US bombed Iran. Even Soviet spies kept an eye on pizza orders during the Cold War. The rock that Taylor Swift flaunted after her engagement brought India's Golconda diamond mines into focus. The Koh-i-Noor, the world's most famous and costliest diamond, was from India's Golconda mines, and was looted and taken to Persia by invader Nadir Shah. About 150 years before that, a Persian oilman's son, Mir Jumla, who helped Aurangzeb in his succession battle, came to rule the Golconda mines, the nest of the Kohinoor. With eye on China, President Trump has led the US into a tariff war. However, it was the issue of tax on a Chinese export, tea, that sparked the American Revolution, which ultimately led to the independence of the US from Britain. Yes, we are referring to the Boston Tea Party of 1773 when Chinese tea was dumped into the Atlantic Ocean. On August 14, 1947, midnight, an unlikely hand unfurled the Indian flag. Leonard Stone, the last British Chief Justice of the Bombay high court, unfurled the Tricolour, while interim PM Jawaharlal Nehru was delivering the 'Tryst with Destiny' speech in Delhi. Stone saluted the Tricolour hours before Nehru's ceremonial flag-hoisting at Delhi's Red Fort. Just 120 Indian soldiers, led by Major Shaitan Singh Bhati, beat back 5,000 Chinese troopers at Rezang La in 1962, preventing China's takeover of Ladakh. A search party found frozen bodies of Indian soldiers still holding guns, showing the last stand in which 110 of the 120 Indians were killed. Revisiting the legendary battle of the 1962 Indo-China war, which is the subject of Farhan Akhtar's 120 Bahadur. When both engines of Transat Flight 236 from Canada to Portugal died out midair over the Atlantic Ocean in 2001 due to a fuel leak, it was still 120km short of an airstrip. The pilots glided the plane to safety, creating a world record and saving 306 people onboard, in what is now known as the Miracle on the Azores. After China's first atomic test, the US and India, as part of a covert operation, tried to place a nuclear-powered listening device at 25,000 feet in the Himalayas near the Nanda Devi peak. A blizzard forced the CIA-IB team to leave the device on the route. A recovery mission, and several search operations, failed to locate the device. A movie on Kanhaiya Lal Teli, a tailor in Udaipur who was beheaded by two Muslim men for sharing a post supporting a BJP leader's comments on Prophet Muhammad, is caught in a storm of controversy. In 1929, publisher Mahashe Rajpal was stabbed to death by a 19-year-old Muslim carpenter for the book Rangeela Rasool.

It's Viral,"From tracking earthquakes in real time to obsessing over AI tools and binge-watching global shows, 2025's online patterns reveal what captured our collective imagination, what worried us, and what brought us joy. The man said that he would start receiving his salary in January 2026, earning between Rs 90,000 and Rs 95,000 per month in a Tier II city. Despite repeated pleas at help desks and boarding gates, many IndiGo passengers claimed they were left without any staff support or announcements even as flights continued to be cancelled or delayed for hours. ""Is this tone okay from a boss? Would you reply or just absorb it,"" read the title of the post shared by the employee on Reddit's Indian Workplace account. In the viral video, Ashish Jain, who had been making his parents believe that the family was shifting into a rented house, finally revealed the truth during their first visit. A Delhi man used ChatGPT to outsmart an online scammer, who ended up panicking and begging for forgiveness. The clip, posted by Shweta Kataria with the text overlay ""unique house of Varanasi,"" has triggered discussion around civic sense and environmental awareness. Tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson announced he finally has a girlfriend after 25 years of searching, and talked about their love story in a detailed post on X. The short clip, originally posted by reel creator Emre Nalcakar, shows him approaching a passenger in the train, locking his wrists to the metal railing and casually leaving the scene while holding the key. A video featuring a woman in ghoongat singing Tera Mera Pyaar Amar while playing guitar has gone viral for its simplicity, as she received praise online for her soothing vocals and confident performance. A video of a woman documenting her cycling experience at 2am in Hyderabad has gained attention online, triggered discussions on feelings of safety and joy in public spaces in safe cities. The mess initially looked like the result of a late-night thief, but a closer look pointed to the raccoon that had apparently crashed through a ceiling panel and helped itself to the bottom rack, where scotch and whisky were stored. A young girl struggling with career-related stress received encouragement from her father during a late-night call.

Environment,"It shows that climate change does not discriminate, affecting people across class, caste, and creed. Groundwater is a major source of water in India, used extensively to support agriculture and other sectors, while also erasing the thirst of billions living in the country. According to the researchers, the mortality spikes during the monsoon months when elephants move more frequently and visibility is lower. Native to India and Sri Lanka, the Talipot palm stands out for its towering height, reaching over 20 meters (65.6 feet). These palms are known for their unusual life cycle, taking between 30 to 80 years to bloom. As heatwaves become longer, harsher and more frequent, cooling has become a basic necessity. A major international study warns that sprawling city growth could leave hundreds of millions without vital water and sanitation services by mid-century. For India, the severe weather just across the Bay of Bengal carries immediate relevance because both regions share interconnected monsoon systems. When Southeast Asia shows strong climate events, India often experiences linked impacts. A hidden stratospheric wind system just broke its rhythm, unleashing synchronised extreme weather across Southeast Asia. Soaring temperatures are expected to damage heritage structures, often built from lime, stone and timber. These buildings were never designed to handle extreme heatwaves, now occurring with a significantly increased frequency. Far beyond the immediate crisis, this disaster is a warning for the future, especially for sourthern region of Asia. The energy security drive appears to contradict the EU's pledge under a trade deal reached in July to more than triple US fuel purchases over the next three years to USD 750 billion Between 2010 and 2017 alone, Africa lost about 106 billion kilograms of forest biomass every year — roughly the weight of 106 million cars disappearing annually. The rhythms with which the glaciers around the world change and retreat may offer clues about how ice worldwide will respond to long-term global warming. The toxic chemicals released through unregulated rare earths mining include ammonium sulphate, sodium cyanide and mercury that are used for two different types of gold mining. Separately, across the Bay of Bengal, another 153 people were killed by a cyclone in the island nation of Sri Lanka, authorities said, with 191 others missing and more than half a million affected nationwide. Signs of distress are already clear. Global wine production has dropped to its lowest level in 60 years, cocoa stocks are at their weakest in a decade, and coffee prices have soared to record highs. Rising temperatures, stronger ultraviolet radiation and increased humidity cause plastics to break down faster into microplastics. Extreme weather events such as storms, floods and strong winds, which are becoming more frequent because of climate change, also carry plastic waste over longer distances. Women and children in climate-vulnerable districts experience significantly poorer health outcomes, raising concerns about India's ability to meet key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Pollution doesn't just cloud Delhi's skyline, it slows its economy, increases household expenses and reduces the city's overall quality of life.

Bihar Assembly,"Nitish Kumar is set to take oath as Bihar Chief Minister for the tenth term on November 20. The ceremony highlights NDA's strong mandate and signals a smooth government transition. The main contention is over the Home Department, which Nitish Kumar has held so far. Earlier, sources said both the JDU and BJP were eyeing the Speaker's post, with the BJP keen to retain it. However, allies now show no disagreement over the Speaker's position. Prashant Kishor said he would ""definitely quit politics"" if the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government fulfils its poll promise of giving Rs 2 lakh each to 1.5 crore women. Rejecting claims that he plans to exit after Jan Suraaj's defeat, Kishor said he will stay in Bihar and intensify his campaign. Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj has drawn a blank in the Bihar Assembly polls, but those writing its political obituary should stop right away. The debutant's 3.4% vote share, which is more than that of the Left parties and the AIMIM combined, is a significant indicator of the traction it has. Though it lost deposits in most seats, it also has third-place finishes in over 54%of the seats contested. A day after the RJD's electoral collapse, Rohini Acharya's shock resignation from politics has pushed a little-known figure, Rameez Nemat, to the centre of a massive family and political crisis. Rohini has accused Tejashwi Yadav's aides, including Rameez, of sidelining and mistreating her. The Congress expressed concerns over a sudden rise in Bihar's voter count ahead of elections, prompting clarifications from the Election Commission. The EC explained the increase was due to late registrations ensuring all eligible voters could participate. Sometimes a few votes make all the difference. The BJP, which won 89 seats out of the 101 it contested in Bihar Assembly polls, lost three seats by slender margins of 30, 178, and 221 votes. Who are the BJP's dozen who lost despite the party's impressive strike rate of 88%? Bihar's 18th Legislative Assembly sees a remarkable rise in wealthy lawmakers, with nine out of ten MLAs now millionaires. The average asset value has nearly doubled in five years, highlighting a growing wealth gap among legislators. The 2025 Bihar Assembly elections saw a decisive shift in Dalit voter support towards the NDA, reflecting changing political dynamics in the state. The alliance's dominance on Scheduled Caste reserved seats highlights growing trust in their governance among Dalit communities. Bihar election results: The RJD, led by Tejashwi Yadav, won 25 of the 143 seats it contested and secured 23 per cent of the vote share, which was the highest for any single party in the election, surpassing both the BJP and the JDU. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav wanted to paint a picture where the tiger and the deer drink side by side. It was that of the Ram Rajya where Bihar would be at peace with itself. But the overzealous, unwarranted and violent roars of the Yadav cadre revived old fears. The noise turned the imagery of the tranquil pond into a reminder of Jungle Raj. Tejashwi's promises, it seemed, were devoid of the promise of harmony. Congress' Kerala unit alleges Election Commission's Special Intensive Revision drive (SIR) drive arbitrarily deleted genuine voters, influencing 128 NDA wins in Bihar election.

Though Paswan said he visited only to congratulate him, rumours suggest he may be seeking a deputy chief minister position for his party after its strong performance. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav wanted to paint a picture where the tiger and the deer drink side by side. It was that of the Ram Rajya where Bihar would be at peace with itself. But the overzealous, unwarranted and violent roars of the Yadav cadre revived old fears. The noise turned the imagery of the tranquil pond into a reminder of Jungle Raj. Tejashwi's promises, it seemed, were devoid of the promise of harmony. Congress' Kerala unit alleges Election Commission's Special Intensive Revision drive (SIR) drive arbitrarily deleted genuine voters, influencing 128 NDA wins in Bihar election. Bihar Chief Minister: While Chirag Paswan, once Nitish Kumar's bete noire, said he went to congratulate the JD(U) chief, rumour mills are on an overdrive, suggesting he may be eyeing the deputy chief minister post. BSP candidate Satish Kumar Yadav clinched a razor-thin 30-vote victory in Ramgarh, his party's lone win in Bihar, after a tense count. The NDA swept back to power in Bihar with a historic 202-seat mandate, decisively defeating the Mahagathbandhan as the BJP and JDU posted an 85 per cent strike rate. The Yadav family feud wasn't a private affair. It was a political earthquake. Tej Pratap's rebellion, Rohini Acharya's social media storm, and their widening rift with Tejashwi split loyalties and handed the NDA a golden opportunity to paint the RJD as a party consumed by infighting. An ageing patriarch, Lalu Prasad Yadav, is now left to witness the unravelling of the political dynasty he built. In a state deeply entrenched in caste politics, Nitish Kumar - a Kurmi leader whose community makes up barely 3% of Bihar's population - rose above caste lines to deliver a counter-punch to opponents who have long claimed dominance over the 32% Muslim–Yadav bloc. The Janata Dal (United) candidate Radha Charan Sah, who contested the Sandesh assembly constituency, won with the lowest margin of 27 votes against RJD's Dipu Singh. Shah provided overall campaign direction, Pradhan strengthened the party's organisational base and ground presence, while Tawde focused on messaging and social coalition-building. Manish Kashyap, a popular YouTuber turned politician, faced defeat in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections despite his strong social media presence. He trailed behind Congress's Abhishek Ranjan and BJP's Umakant Singh. Former IPS officer and Bihar's ""Singham"" Shivdeep Lande faced a setback in his political debut, losing both Araria and Jamalpur seats in the 2025 Assembly elections. Tensions boiled over outside the Mohania market committee counting centre in Kaimur district as BJP and BSP supporters clashed during the final rounds of counting for the Ramgarh Assembly seat. After a landlide victory in the Bihar Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated the NDA's win with party workers at the BJP headquarters in Delhi and launched an attack on the Mahagathbandhan. Taking a veiled jibe at RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav and the ""jungle raj"" during his reign, PM Modi said that the people have quit supporting those who are out on bail. Addressing BJP workers in Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that members within the Congress have grown discontented with what he called the ""Muslim League Maoist Congress,"" predicting another split in the party. The Mahagathbandhan's collapse in Bihar stems from deep internal rifts, a divisive projection of Tejashwi Yadav as CM face, lacklustre and poorly coordinated campaigning by Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, a misfired SIR narrative, and bitter seat-sharing battles that left allies contesting against each other. In his victory speech, the PM hailed the landslide majority as the victory of the developmental politics orchestrated by both Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar and the Central government. He also took a sharp jibe at the Mahagathbandhan over its abysmal performance in Bihar. Tej Pratap Yadav declared the ""end of family rule"" in Bihar as he launched an emotional attack on alleged ""Jaichands"" within the RJD after the party's collapse. Veteran politician and BJP rebel Yashwant Sinha's sarcastic tweet has become an accidental political prophecy in Bihar Assembly elections. Three days before Bihar poll results, he ""predicted"" an NDA sweep—and the alliance actually crossed 200 seats. The 88-year-old's post has now gone viral. With the NDA's landslide victory, the spotlight is on its bigger constituents, like the BJP, the JDU and the LJP. Amid the spotlight on the bigger parties, NDA constituent Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) has won five out of the six seats he contested, registering an impressive strike rate. This is why former Bihar CM Manjhi is the NDA's secret superstar. This special report covers the National Democratic Alliance's resounding victory in the Bihar assembly elections, where it secured a massive majority. The broadcast highlights the celebrations within the BJP and its allied parties, attributing the success to the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. The report notes the significant contributions of allies Chirag Paswan, Jitan Ram Manjhi, and Upendra Kushwaha, and discusses the victory's implications. Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated, 'I heartily congratulate Chief Minister Nitish Kumar ji and our NDA family allies, Chirag Paswan ji, Jeetanram Manji ji and Upendra Khuswaha ji for this resounding victory'. The programme further analyses the BJP's high strike rate and the role of 'mahila' (women) and 'yuva' (youth) voters in delivering this decisive mandate. Rahul Gandhi, along with all the other Mahagathbandhan leaders, took part in a 16-day-long Voter Adhikar Yatra in Bihar, emphasising vote chori as the central claim. However, that failed to create any impact among the voters of Bihar.

"India got lucky, he lives and breathes India: Putin’s big praise for PM Modi","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s relentless dedication to his work, observing that the Prime Minister “lives and breathes India"". In an exclusive interview with India Today, when asked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Russian leader said, “We have very trustworthy and friendly relations. He is a very reliable person. In that sense, I’m speaking very sincerely. India got lucky. He lives and breathes India"". Putin said it was a “great pleasure” to speak with the Prime Minister, whom he described as “a person of integrity”. “He is deeply committed to strengthening ties between India and Russia across a wide spectrum, particularly on key areas of economic cooperation, defence, humanitarian engagement, and high-technology development. It is very interesting to meet him,” Putin added. On Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s earlier visit to Moscow, the Russian President recalled that the two leaders had an engaging conversation, “purely like humans.” “He travelled here, and we sat together at my residence. We drank tea the whole evening and discussed a range of topics. We simply had an interesting conversation, purely like humans,” said Vladimir Putin. The Russian President arrived in New Delhi on Thursday for a two-day visit at PM Modi’s invitation, aimed at further strengthening a durable eight-decade-old bilateral partnership that has remained steady despite global geopolitical upheavals. The discussions are expected to focus on cooperation in defence, trade, and technology. In a rare and personal gesture, Modi received Putin at the airport with a warm embrace, where the two leaders shared a hug before heading together in the Prime Minister’s car to his official residence, where the Russian leader was later hosted for a private dinner. Nearly three months earlier, when Modi met Putin in the Chinese city of Tianjin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, the Russian President had rode him in his own vehicle, a symbolic gesture that drew global attention, particularly as it came amid strained geopolitical currents and US's tariff pressure on India over New Delhi's relations with Moscow.- EndsPublished By: Priya PareekPublished On: Dec 4, 2025Tune InMust Watch",real,https://www.indiatoday.in,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-got-lucky-pm-modi-lives-and-breathes-india-vladimir-putin-to-india-today-2830963-2025-12-04

Putin Interview,"Russian President Putin's interview on India Today Highlights: In a world exclusive, Russian President Vladimir Putin told India Today that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is “not someone who gives in to pressure,” when asked whether the US was arm-twisting India with tariffs. His remarks to India Today Group’s Anjana Om Kashyap and Geeta Mohan came ahead of his two-day visit to India on Thursday. The full interview was shot inside the historic Ekaterina (Catherine) Hall in the Kremlin. In the exclusive interview with India Today TV ahead of his two-day visit to India, Putin was asked whether he believed immortality was achievable - a question triggered by his earlier hot-mic exchange with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing that had gone viral. Putin explained that although life spans can continue to rise through advances in healthcare, true immortality is not possible. He pointed to historic improvements in public health to support his argument, noting how countries such as India have seen dramatic gains in longevity and reductions in infant mortality due to sustained medical efforts. Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the idea of human immortality, saying that while scientific progress can greatly extend life expectancy, “everything has an end; only God is eternal.” When asked whether immortality is achievable, the anchor received a reflective answer from Putin. He said that “everything has an end, only God is eternal,” but added that human life can certainly be extended. “We can extend longevity of life, 100%. I am sure we can,” he said, citing historic improvements in public health. Putin pointed out that 77 years ago, India’s average life expectancy was just 31 years, whereas it is now about 70. He also noted that infant mortality in India has fallen fourfold, underscoring how healthcare advancements drive such progress. Putin said it was a “great pleasure” to speak with the Prime Minister, whom he described as “a person of integrity”. ""We have very trustworthy and friendly relations. He is a very reliable person. In that sense, I’m speaking very sincerely. India got lucky. He lives and breathes India,"" he told India Today TV. When asked about Western newspapers frequently claiming that he wants to restore the old Soviet Union, Putin said he would not explain his position to them because they refuse to listen. He added that they misuse their dominance and monopoly in Western media to justify their aggressive stance toward Russia. Vladimir Putin said that Indian culture is like a fairytale, noting that Russians have enjoyed Indian movies and songs since the USSR era. He described the connection as ""heart to heart"" and added that Russia will do everything possible to ensure that the interest in Indian culture, built over decades, remains strong. Vladimir Putin said there are several powerful intelligence agencies in the world, including the CIA, Russia’s own services, and Mossad. He added that it is better not to reveal too much information for others to overinterpret, but noted that he is satisfied with how Russia’s intelligence services have evolved. Vladimir Putin described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a reliable and sincere leader, saying it is very pleasant to talk to someone of such integrity. He noted that Modi is committed to strengthening Russia-India ties in defence, energy, and culture, and added that their conversations are engaging and interesting, ""like humans."" Vladimir Putin said that Gaza is a complex issue that has remained unresolved for a long time, and any deal should not be rushed. He emphasised that governance should be organised so that control can be transferred to the Palestinian people, reaffirming his support for a Palestinian state. Vladimir Putin said that Russia is looking for additional goods to buy from India, aiming to increase Indian imports and bridge the trade imbalance between the two countries. Vladimir Putin said that India and China are both close friends of his. He described Prime Minister Modi and Xi Jinping as wise leaders, determined to resolve complex issues, and emphasised that Russia does not interfere in any country’s bilateral matters. Vladimir Putin said there is no need to rush, noting that Europe was unprepared for the single currency and faced problems with the euro. He added that Russia is not planning to create a BRICS currency anytime soon. Vladimir Putin said that the world is changing at a rapid pace, with new centres of power emerging and significant transformations underway. He highlighted the Global South in particular, noting that not only India but also Indonesia is on the rise. Putin added that Africa is developing rapidly, and with its young population, the continent will soon aspire to a higher standard of living. Vladimir Putin took a jab at the UK and Germany’s economies, saying most of Europe is staring at a recession and questioning the relevance of the G7, while countries like India rank third globally in economic power. He noted that the G7 is still important, adding that he stopped attending the G8 long ago, and slammed the group’s current actions as “disgusting,” wishing them “good luck.” Vladimir Putin said that Nato poses a threat to both Europe and Russia, undermining Russia’s security and acting as a military alliance against the country. He added that while Ukraine should remain neutral, Russia will continue to protect its interests. Speaking on the endgame, Vladimir Putin said that Russia did not start the war and blamed the West for pushing Ukraine toward conflict. He added that Russian citizens in Donbas were persecuted and emphasised Russia’s deep ties with Kyiv, stating that Russia will completely liberate Donbas. Vladimir Putin said that the United States still buys nuclear fuel from Russia for its own power plants, including uranium for reactors operating in the US. He questioned why India should not have the same privilege, adding that the matter deserves thorough examination and that Russia is ready to discuss it, including with President Trump. ""I am absolutely certain that he is sincere about bringing peace to Ukraine and genuinely wants to save lives. But there are also economic and political interests involved,"" said Putin. ""Absolutely no doubt that President Trump had genuine intentions. I am confident that his efforts to bring peace to Ukraine are sincere,"" Putin said, referring to their Alaska meeting. Vladimir Putin said that neither he nor Prime Minister Modi has ever, despite pressure, used their collaboration to act against anyone. When asked about the US President, he pointed out that Donald Trump has his own agenda, but in their dealings, India and Russia do not cause harm to others, and he wants other countries to take note of this.",real,https://www.indiatoday.in,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/vladimir-putin-interview-on-india-today-live-updates-world-exclusive-russian-president-2830882-2025-12-04
Putin India Visit,"Reacting to Vladimir Putin’s India visit, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor called it “hugely significant,” noting the India–Russia relationship has remained important for decades. He said that in a turbulent global climate, it is essential for India to strengthen reliable partnerships. Tharoor stressed that this meeting shouldn’t be seen as undermining ties with other nations, as “we are a nation that has always believed in sovereign autonomy” and can engage independently with different powers. He underlined Russia’s recent value in energy supplies and defence, recalling how S-400 systems shielded Indian cities, including Delhi, during Operation Sindoor. Any agreements finalized now, he said, only deepen a vital partnership without affecting relations with America or China. Commenting on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India, former diplomat Veena Sikri noted that it was ""a very important gesture that our prime minister decided to go to the airport personally to receive President Putin"". She said the trip is expected to be highly productive, with major discussions likely to focus on defence ties. Sikri pointed out that systems like the BrahMos missile and the S-400 air defence platform — both central to recent Operation Sindoor — highlight the depth of cooperation, and she recalled that “President Putin has said that he's willing to give the transfer of technology.” She added that trade will also be a key topic, stressing India’s need to boost its exports to Russia and predicting that these issues will receive detailed attention during the talks. On Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India, Russian chess grandmaster and political commentator Sergey Karjakin expressed optimism about bilateral ties, saying he hopes the cooperation between the two nations “will grow,” noting that Russia sees India as “a friendly country.” He added that he expects many future collaborations, ""maybe also in chess"". Karjakin highlighted the strength of both nations’ chess traditions, pointing out the rise of young Indian talents. He acknowledged that maintaining competitive pressure will be challenging for Russia, given that ""there is not only Gukesh, there is also Erigaisi and Praggnanandhaa,"" any of whom, he said, could become the next world champion. Karjakin concluded that while this poses a challenge for Russian players, he is “happy” and congratulates India on producing such formidable new stars. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin at his official residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg. Elaborating on Russia's stand on its war with Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, ""We did not start this war but the West and Ukraine started this. After eight years of relentless violence against us in Donbas, something that the West does not talk about, the war started"". He said that Russia will finish it when it has achieved the target we set at the very outset. ""We did not recognise these self-proclaimed independent states. We told Ukraine that people do not want to live with you. Ukraine is required to pull back its troops from our territory and stop killing people for this war to end"". Vladimir Putin, in the exclusive interview with India Today, said that US companies are eager to invest in and work with Russia, but they are just waiting for this war to end. ""They told us that we should not forget them. We have letters from American companies, asking us not to forget about their existence and resume cooperation"". Reflecting upon his August 15 summit with Donald Trump in Alaska, Vladimir Putin said that Trump has genuine intentions to end the Ukraine-Russia war. ""His sincerity is genuine. I believe that the US is actively seeking a solution to this problem"". On US President Donald Trump reportedly ""weaponising tariffs"", Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Trump pursued his own policy. ""He is acting in good faith, I presume. Our experts believe that there are risks involved. But it is up to us to choose which economic policy to adopt"". ""Neither me nor PM Modi give in to any pressure. US President Donald Trump has his own agenda. We have our own, which does not hurt anyone, it just takes care of our progress,"" Putin said while reacting to the US sanctions and tariffs. ""There is a certain decline in the trade volume in the first nine months of this year but overall it remains almost the same. Supply of Russian oil, petroleum, crude oil and other minerals remains almost on the same level as before,"" President Vladimir Putin replied on whether India has cut down on its oil imports from Russia. Sharing his thoughts on India's proposed deals with Russia in terms of buying S-400/500 and other defence equipment, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is not merely selling something to New Delhi and India is not just buying. ""It is a different kind of relationship we share. We are sharing technology with India. The level of trust between the two peoples is beyond bilateral ties"". Reacting to the US pressure on India by imposing 50 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that both India and the world both recognise that India is a major global power and not a colony. ""PM Modi is the one who does not succumb to pressure. Indian people can take pride in their leadership"". Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the energy cooperation, especially the oil trade between India and Russia, remains unaffected by external pressures. Russian President Vladimir Putin refused to reveal key agreements that are on his agenda during his two-day visit to India. Russian President Vladimir Putin cleared the air on his car ride with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the SCO meeting earlier this year. He said that it was not pre-arranged. ""My car was waiting and I asked him if he would want to hop in. That's all"". Our collaboration with India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi transcends mutual ties, says President Vladimir Putin, who lauds the Make In India initiative. India's progress has been substantial in the last 77 years, says Russian President Vladimir Putin in an interview with India Today. The biggest interview of the year is finally here as Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to India Today's Geeta Mohan and Anjana Om Kashyap.

He was received by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Palam airport and the dup headed to 7, Lok Kalyan Marg for dinner. Tune into India Today TV for the full interview. During President Vladimir Putin’s visit, India and Russia are expected to review several major defence initiatives, including plans to procure additional Su-30 fighter jets and air defence systems such as the S-400/500 and the Verba VSHORAD. Discussions will also cover the proposed second overhaul of Su-30MKI aircraft, which aims to upgrade around 100 jets to modern standards in partnership with Russia, separate from the indigenous upgrade of 84 aircraft by HAL. Talks are likely to include India’s interest in acquiring over 300 long-range R-37 missiles and securing timely delivery of the remaining S-400 squadrons. Both sides may also explore developing lighter missile variants like BrahMos-NG and extended-range systems to further boost India’s strike capabilities. (With inputs from Manjeet Negi) Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin arrive at 7 Lok Kalyan Marg, the official residence of the Prime Minister. JDU leader KC Tyagi responded to Rahul Gandhi’s claims by saying that established protocol allows a visiting head of state to decide which leaders they wish to meet. Likewise, any Indian leader who wants such a meeting must request an appointment through the Ministry of External Affairs or the concerned embassy. He questioned Rahul Gandhi on which of these procedures he had followed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed his ""friend"" Vladimir Putin to India and posted his pictures with the Russian President after the latter's arrival in New Delhi. ""Delighted to welcome my friend, President Putin to India. Looking forward to our interactions later this evening and tomorrow.

Congress MP Rajeev Shukla stated that it has traditionally been the practice to introduce visiting national presidents to the Leader of the Opposition, a protocol followed by former Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh. He agreed with Rahul Gandhi’s observation, noting that this tradition is no longer being upheld and should not be disregarded. Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury criticised the government over Opposition leaders not being allowed to meet foreign dignitaries, saying, ""The true nature of this government has been exposed—it does not respect democracy or democratic freedoms. It is disgraceful that, with the president of another country visiting, the government is demonstrating that democracy in our nation exists only in name.""

He emphasised that Russia is keen on balancing trade and is very interested in purchasing more Indian goods.

He emphasised that India is at a pivotal moment, highlighting the growing significance of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and drug discovery. According to him, India has a chance to pursue innovative research and development, investing in biologics, gene therapies, and advanced treatments that can benefit not just its population but the global community. This shift could allow India to move from being the world's “pharmacy” to becoming a leading global innovator. Achieving this potential, he added, will require thoughtful investment from both government and private sectors. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin are likely to have another 'car-pooling' moment on their way to the Lok Kalyan Marg residence of the PM, sources told India Today.

The session highlighted ongoing opportunities to deepen cooperation across political, economic, and cultural domains. Government sources indicate that President Putin’s visit is expected to significantly strengthen economic cooperation between India and Russia. Accompanied by a large delegation of business leaders, the Russian President’s trip is seen as an opportunity to address India’s trade deficit with Russia and explore ways to expand Indian exports, particularly in pharmaceuticals, automobiles, agricultural products, and marine goods.

Abdullah said these strong relations are expected to continue in the future. He also suggested that India’s close relationship with Russia could potentially play a constructive role in helping end the war in Ukraine. If India can use its goodwill with Moscow to contribute to peace efforts, he said, it would mark a significant diplomatic achievement for the country. BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi dismissed Rahul Gandhi’s claim that the Leader of Opposition is barred from meeting visiting dignitaries, calling it baseless. She urged the Opposition to avoid unnecessary accusations and focus on public interest. Sarangi said that with the Russian President visiting, the LoP should welcome him rather than project negativity, adding that the government treats everyone with respect and that the LoP should act with dignity. BJD MP Sasmit Patra called Vladimir Putin’s India visit highly significant, stressing the long-standing depth of Indo-Russian defense, cultural, and economic ties. He said the trip could open doors to new initiatives benefiting both nations and urged looking beyond narrow issues like crude oil to appreciate the wider relationship. Patra noted, ""It's an extremely significant and important visit of the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, especially because both Russia and India have deep ties.""

Commenting on LoP Rahul Gandhi’s allegation that the Opposition is not allowed to meet visiting dignitaries, Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav said that many long-standing traditions have been altered, and this is yet another example. She noted that foreign diplomats and leaders traditionally met both the government and the opposition, but the BJP is now changing these practices. Responding to Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi’s claim that the Opposition is not permitted to meet visiting dignitaries, BJP MP Narhari Amin said Rahul Gandhi should reflect on how he criticises India during his foreign visits. He argued that political differences should be addressed within the country, but Gandhi spoke against the government and India abroad. According to Amin, this behaviour is why the government may restrict such interactions. He added that during the Congress era, some opposition leaders would even support the government. Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth welcomed Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov at Air Force Station Palam in New Delhi today. Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan was also in attendance.

He added that the visit would centre on boosting the India-Russia partnership, with particular emphasis on economic cooperation, saying it was ""a very important visit"". Flex boards welcoming Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian national flags have been placed around Palam Air Base. Invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Putin will be on a state visit to India from 4 to 5 December 2025 for the 23rd India–Russia Annual Summit. During the visit, he is scheduled to hold talks with PM Modi. President Droupadi Murmu will also formally receive him and host a banquet in his honour. Commenting on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India, West Asia strategist Waiel Awwad told ANI that India views Russia not just as a strategic partner, but also a reliable ally. ""... Russia is considered by India not only as a strategic partner, but also a faithful one. Over the last seven decades, we have seen that Russian involvement in Indian affairs has always been pro-India... India has to utilise the opportunity of the visit of the Russian President... India also has to present its view of the Ukraine war, which India has already been saying. The Prime Minister said it many times that this is not an era of war and he wanted to end the Russia-Ukraine war,"" Waiel Awwad said. ""If that message goes well with President Putin, especially when the United States is also using its own influential diplomatic channels to pressurise Putin and Zelenskyy to agree to the peace plan. That will ease the tension on India. India has also noticed that the American tariff has been threatening India, especially in the energy sector, where India has sharply reduced the purchase from Russia, while they are buying from the US. If this war is put to and end, then India will be more comfortable, not only in buying Russian oil, but also to make 'Make in India' more successful..,"" he added. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is expected to receive Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host him for a private dinner at 7 Lok Kalyan Marg, sources told India Today. Straight talk, global stakes.... Catch the Global Super Exclusive interview with Vladimir Putin tonight at 9 PM, only on India Today#GlobalSuperExclusive #Promo #VladimirPutin #PutinOnIndiaToday | @Geeta_mohan @anjanaomkashyap pic.twitter.com/8VJuzxf3R2 Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said it is a protocol that visiting dignitaries meet the LoP. ""All the policies of this government are based on one principle -- they want to capture everything, do not let other voices be heard, don't want to hear other people and are breaking protocols. Every democracy has a protocol which should be followed,"" she told reporters in the Parliament House complex. ""The government is very insecure that this is a reflection of it. When dignitaries come, they meet the LoP, this is protocol so what is the need to break that protocol. This can only be insecurity and nothing else,"" she said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused the government of instructing visiting foreign dignitaries to avoid meeting the Leader of the Opposition, citing its “insecurity.” His comments came just hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin’s two-day visit to India. Gandhi, the Lok Sabha Leader of the Opposition, said it has been customary for visiting foreign leaders to meet the LoP, but alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Ministry of External Affairs were not adhering to this practice. ""Normally the tradition is that those who come from abroad have a meeting with the LoP. This used to happen during (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee ji's time, Manmohan Singh ji's time, it has been a tradition but what happens these days is that when foreign dignitaries come and when I go abroad, the government suggests to them to not meet the LoP,"" Gandhi told reporters in Parliament House complex. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nearly 27-hour visit to New Delhi has gained added significance amid a sharp downturn in India-US relations. The trip comes at a time when ties between the two countries are facing possibly their worst phase in two decades, following Washington’s imposition of steep tariffs on Indian goods, including a 25 per cent levy on India’s purchase of Russian crude oil. The impact of these American sanctions on India’s Russian crude imports is expected to feature prominently in the summit discussions. Following the summit, President Putin will inaugurate the new India channel of the Russian state-run broadcaster, after which he will attend a state banquet hosted in his honour by President Droupadi Murmu. The Russian leader is expected to depart India around 9 pm on Friday. During the summit talks, New Delhi is likely to raise concerns over the growing trade deficit resulting from India’s large-scale purchase of Russian crude oil. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host a private dinner for Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, shortly after his arrival in Delhi, aimed at strengthening the broader strategic and economic partnership amid strained India-US relations. The summit between Modi and Putin on Friday is expected to focus on enhancing defence cooperation, safeguarding India-Russia trade from external pressures, and exploring collaboration on small modular reactors, in a meeting likely to draw close attention from Western capitals.

Traffic restrictions and regulated pedestrian movement are expected near sensitive zones, with officials assuring that alerts will be issued in advance to minimise disruption. (PTI) Senior Delhi Police officials are overseeing route security, traffic management, and area sanitisation at sites expected to be part of the Russian President’s itinerary.

Sanchar Saathi,"Sanchar Saathi is a digital citizen-safety platform launched by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to protect mobile users from fraud, identity misuse, and unauthorized SIM connections. As cases of mobile-related scams, digital impersonation, and telecom-based financial fraud increased across India, the government created Sanchar Saathi as a single, transparent portal where users can check and control all mobile numbers linked to their identity. At its core, Sanchar Saathi offers three major services. The first is TAFCOP (Telecom Analytics for Fraud Management and Consumer Protection), which allows users to see how many SIM cards are issued using their Aadhaar-linked identity. If an unknown number appears, it can be flagged or blocked immediately. This is especially useful in cases where fraudsters obtain SIMs using stolen or forged identity documents. The second major feature is the CEIR (Central Equipment Identity Register). Through this system, anyone who loses their phone whether through theft or misplacement can quickly block the device using its IMEI number. Once reported, the phone becomes unusable on all Indian networks, discouraging mobile theft. If the device is recovered, the portal also allows users to unblock it. The third component involves AI-driven fraud detection, where Sanchar Saathi analyses telecom data to identify suspicious patterns, fake registrations, and SIM misuse. This helps both individuals and telecom operators stay ahead of emerging fraud techniques. Overall, Sanchar Saathi combines transparency, consumer control, and technological vigilance. It empowers citizens, reduces digital vulnerability, and strengthens India’s broader cyber and telecom security ecosystem. Shashi Tharoor’s 2022 biography ‘Ambedkar: A Life’ is a fitting pick on Babasaheb’s death anniversary—immensely readable and courageous to even dwell on his flaws There is a lot of talk about Sanchar Saathi nowadays but how useful is the app? Well in some cases it can be pretty handy. The Sanchar Saathi app pre-installation row has again raised questions about the safety of your personal information. Is it time to reassess your digital footprint? Government removes mandatory pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app for mobile manufacturers The Centre’s push to make the Sanchar Saathi app mandatory triggered a swift political firestorm, forcing a dramatic U-turn within 48 hours amid Pegasus-style surveillance fears. So, what's the status now? Mandatory or not, Sanchar Saathi is an unnecessary app. This app solves zero cyber security issues because its functionality is superfluous and performative. In fact, Saathi is a waste of taxpayer’s money. Is it mandatory or is it not? The jury is still out on Sanchar Saathi app. But it is clear that the government wants it pre-installed on phones, including iPhone. That may lead to another tiff between Apple and India. Again. School Assembly News Headlines for December 3: From diplomacy and defence to culture and controversy, the day’s headlines underscore shifting priorities at home and abroad. Stay tuned as more layers unfold in tomorrow’s top stories. The government and its Sanchar Saathi app were meant to work 24x7 for phone users. Snooping fears made people protest, and communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia made the app optional. People fail to realise the benefits of moves until they are shoved down their throats, like Nitin Gadkari did with ethanol-mixed petrol. The backlash over mandatory pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi highlights fears of a potent anti-fraud app morphing into an intrusive state-surveillance tool Sanchar Saathi app: Jyotiraditya Scindia's clarification comes amid a massive uproar over Centre's directions to phone manufacturers to pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app on all phones. Union Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said the Sanchaar Saathi app is optional and users can delete it, but the government directive says the app’s functions cannot be disabled or restricted. India has notified phone makers that Sanchar Saathi, an app that aims to track stolen phones, must be preinstalled on all new phones in the next 90 days. It makes India unique among all democracies to force something like this on citizens. The Centre's directive to pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app on smartphones has sparked intense debate over privacy and government surveillance. While the government insists on cybersecurity benefits, opposition voices warn of a potential intrusion into citizens' private lives. Apple seems to be at loggerheads with the Indian government once again. And once again, it is standing firm on its philosophy of not allowing third-party or government apps on iPhones, at least at this point in time according to a report. Indian government wants Sanchar Saathi app installed on all phones in the country. This is mandatory and users will not be able to delete it. At the same time when we look at the information that Saathi app can access on a phone, it seems too much. As government mandates mandatory install of Sanchar Saathi app in all phones in India, many on social media are comparing it to the Pegasus spyware. Of course, that is hyperbole. But the government demand sure comes across rather blunt and in poor faith. It is official. Hours after a news report surfaced about a secret memo to phone companies, the government has now confirmed that it wants Sanchar Saathi app installed on all phones in India. This is mandatory and the users will not be able to delete or disable the app. What is Sanchar Saathi? We explain. Sanchar Saathi helps you check your mobile handset’s genuineness, report fraud calls, and block lost or stolen phones. Downloading and setting it up is quick and easy, so every smartphone user in India can stay protected. The Department of Telecommunications has ordered all phone makers to pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app to curb IMEI fraud, improve device verification and strengthen telecom security, with strict compliance rules and penalties. On this Special Report, the focus is on the political storm triggered by Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury bringing a stray dog to Parliament. Chowdhury defended her action, remarking that 'those sitting inside Parliament bite, not dogs,' and later mimicked a barking sound at reporters when asked about a potential privilege motion. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has condemned her conduct, with leaders demanding strict action for allegedly insulting parliamentary dignity. The programme also features a debate with Congress spokesperson Salman Soz, who highlights the depreciating Indian rupee and economic concerns, and BJP’s Tuhin Sinha, who accuses the Congress of diversionary tactics. Senior Journalist Neerja Chowdhury weighs in on the declining civility in public discourse. The big talking point of this episode of News Today is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi, his first since the start of the Ukraine war. A significant political row has ignited following Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's claim that Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru proposed using government funds to build the Babri Masjid, a move he alleges was opposed by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The Congress party has strongly denied these allegations. This development comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin undertakes a historic visit to India, during which Russia's State Duma ratified the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics (RELOS) agreement. The pact is set to deepen defence cooperation, allowing mutual use of military facilities. Discussions during the visit are also expected to cover the S-400 'Sudarshan Chakra' air defence system and potential talks on the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet, signaling a strengthening of strategic ties between the two nations. A massive political row has erupted after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh claimed that the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had proposed using public funds to build the Babri Masjid. The government has reversed a directive that would have mandated the pre-installation of the 'Sanchar Saathi' app on smartphones.

The discussion also covers recent parliamentary protests regarding air pollution levels in the capital and a privilege motion controversy involving a Member of Parliament. In a major policy reversal, the Centre has withdrawn its directive mandating the pre-installation of the 'Sanchar Saathi' app on all new smartphones sold in India. The rollback comes just 48 hours after the Department of Telecommunications issued the order, which triggered a 'privacy storm' and backlash from opposition parties and tech giants like Apple and Google. While the government initially pitched the app as a shield against cyber fraud, critics raised alarms over surveillance and lack of consent. The app will now remain optional for users. Amid massive uproar, the government has rolled back the mandatory pre-installation of the Sanchar Saathi app order. In this Special Report, the focus is on the intensifying row over Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury bringing a stray puppy to Parliament. Facing a potential privilege motion, Chowdhury mimicked a dog barking at reporters and stated, ‘The dog I brought doesn't bite, but those sitting inside Parliament do.’ She argued the government is ignoring critical issues like pollution and BLO suicides to focus on her pet. Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi backed her, remarking that pets are not allowed, but ‘biting’ individuals are inside the House.

While the government, represented by Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister of Maharashtra Brijesh Singh, argues the move is essential to curb cybercrime and 'digital arrest' scams, privacy advocates raise alarms. Apar Gupta, Founder Director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, questions the lack of transparency, stating, 'The Department of Telecommunications has not officially released the full text of the directions.' Supreme Court Advocate N.S. Nappinai argues the mandatory nature of the directive violates fundamental rights. The programme also discusses the government's latest clarification that the app remains optional for users.

He argues that the move is a 'positive step' to combat the 'massive amount of fraud' and 'digital arrest' cases plaguing India.

Union Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has stated the app is optional and can be deleted, countering allegations of snooping from opposition leaders like Shiv Sena (UBT)'s Priyanka Chaturvedi and Congress's Shama Mohamed. This political clash is juxtaposed with grim news from Haryana, where the state of law and order and sports infrastructure is under scrutiny following the murder of national para-athlete Rohit Dhankhar and the death of 16-year-old basketball player Hardik Rathi due to a collapsing pole. Congress MP Deepender Hooda has criticized the BJP government for alleged 'criminal negligence'.

Congress National Spokesperson Dr. Shama Mohamed argues the move mirrors ""surveillance"" tactics, citing the Pegasus controversy and questioning why the app was initially mandated for pre-installation. Countering her, BJP National Spokesperson Sanju Verma asserts the app is a critical tool against cyber fraud, claiming it has already helped block millions of suspicious connections. The debate escalates with personal barbs as both sides clash over privacy rights versus digital security. In this Special Report, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi dismisses Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia’s assurance that the Sanchar Saathi app is optional. Speaking to India Today, Chaturvedi argues that the government’s written mandate contradicts Scindia’s verbal clarification, stating, ‘It is the written words and the written words are pretty clear that it is mandated and they cannot alter, change or deny access.’ She labels the move a ‘surveillance mechanism’ and questions why a government app must be pre-loaded on smartphones, comparing it to practices in Russia. The discussion follows the Centre’s directive to manufacturers to install the app to curb cyber fraud.",real,https://www.indiatoday.in,https://www.indiatoday.in/topic/sanchar-saathi
Delhi Pollution,"The air quality in Delhi has deteriorated hugely as winter sets in, with smog covering the city and people being exposed to serious health hazards. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said a number of areas in the city have seen particulate matter (PM2.5) levels exceeding 400 micrograms per cubic meter, much higher than the safe limit of 60 micrograms. Experts explain that various reasons are behind the decline. Crop stubble burning in nearby states, vehicle emissions, construction dust, and industrial pollutants are combining with cold temperatures and slow wind speeds and getting trapped close to the ground. Authorities have also put temporary curbs on construction work and asked neighboring states to cut down on stubble burning. Odd-even vehicle restrictions and higher usage of public transport are being promoted to reduce vehicle emissions. Delhi is bracing for a significant decline in air quality, with pollution levels expected to worsen through midweek, according to the Center's Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS). Schools and hospitals are reporting that there is an increase in the complaints of respiratory origin, particularly in children, the elderly, and chronic patients. The government in Delhi has asked residents to undertake less outdoor activity, wear face masks, and use air purifiers within their homes. Temporary restrictions on construction activities and requests to neighboring states to limit stubble burning have also been imposed. Odd-even restrictions on vehicle usage and increased use of public transport are being encouraged to minimize vehicular emissions. The tag on shops, ""We have no branches anywhere"", can't be an advertisement for trees in Delhi, which is battling an air emergency. There is no logic why government staffers with greased palms should be going about lopping entire branches of trees in the name of pruning with an AQI above 400. There's smog, and there's brain fog. Amid the persistent air pollution in the national capital, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for cold wave in Delhi for Friday, with minimum temperatures expected to fall to 4-6 degrees Celsius. DMK MP P Wilson called Delhi a “gas chamber” amid worsening pollution and asked the government to avoid holding Parliament’s winter session during peak smog. He urged decentralising administration and shifting institutions out of Delhi. Delhi pollution: The Centre, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha, said the national capital logged its lowest average AQI (air quality index) in the last eight years (2018-25). Air pollution in India is no longer a winter phenomenon. Experts warn that rising emissions, urban heat and industrial activity are keeping air quality unsafe throughout the year. A multi-city study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) found that increases in pollution levels were linked with a rise in emergency room visits for respiratory problems. Pollution data showed transport emissions as the biggest contributor at 18.4%, while forecasts indicate the capital will remain in the ‘very poor’ category in the coming days with mist and haze persisting. The farmer is seen as a perpetrator and the foremost culpable reason for the severe air pollution in Delhi. This blame is cast with nonchalance, with the farmer seeming to be almost equivalent to a bad samaritan littering the street. Delhi's air quality has deteriorated sharply, reaching severe pollution levels again. Experts warn that normalising pollution is dangerous and urge protective measures. According to scientific studies, burning cow dung cakes releases higher levels of harmful pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and black carbon compared to wood. At the heart of the problem is how far Delhi has strayed from global and national clean-air benchmarks. The study claims that the pollution in Delhi-NCR air shot up is fuelled by a blend of PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO) emitted mainly from vehicles and other local sources. The Supreme Court enquired about the scale of dust emissions from vehicles and commercial sources, asking, ""How much dust particles are being thrown by vehicles, there are commercial vehicles and how they are multiplied and thrown in air. There are several reasons. Which one is the biggest one? Mumbai will impose GRAP-IV restrictions if the AQI tops 200 for three consecutive days. Interestingly, Delhi, battling severe air pollution for over a month, has not seen new curbs despite the AQI consistently going beyond 300 in the past few days. Delhi's air quality worsened again on Monday, with the AQI at 298, just a few notches from the 'very poor' range. This follows a short-lived improvement in air quality to the 'poor' category due to strong winds. Delhi faced another day of poor air quality with AQI levels remaining high across the city and NCR, causing discomfort among residents. Despite slight improvements, pollution hotspots continue to pose health risks as winter sets in. Delhi’s notorious winter pollution has peaked, but the national capital’s urban mess has been decades in the making and an unending ordeal Delhi Police have uncovered videos that could widen the probe into the AQI protest at Kartavya Path, revealing support for banned extremist groups. This development intensifies scrutiny on the organisations and individuals involved in the demonstration. The national capital recorded an AQI of 338 on Saturday morning, extending its streak of 'very poor' air quality to half the month of November. Calling air pollution a national health emergency, Rahul Gandhi demanded an immediate and detailed debate in Parliament along with a strict, enforceable action plan to protect children from long-term damage. Even as doctors flag rising infertility, premature childbirth and cancer risks from Delhi’s air, the city is still relying on a 2018 Pollution Action Plan. On this Special Report, the focus is on the political storm triggered by Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury bringing a stray dog to Parliament. Chowdhury defended her action, remarking that 'those sitting inside Parliament bite, not dogs,' and later mimicked a barking sound at reporters when asked about a potential privilege motion. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has condemned her conduct, with leaders demanding strict action for allegedly insulting parliamentary dignity. The programme also features a debate with Congress spokesperson Salman Soz, who highlights the depreciating Indian rupee and economic concerns, and BJP’s Tuhin Sinha, who accuses the Congress of diversionary tactics. Senior Journalist Neerja Chowdhury weighs in on the declining civility in public discourse. On this Special Report, the focus is on the intensifying political row after Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury brought a stray dog to Parliament. BJP National Spokesperson Tuhin Sinha dismisses the act as ‘drama’ and ‘canine antics’, stating, ‘When I first saw Renuka ji barking, I actually thought it was an AI video.’ Congress National Spokesperson Salman Soz defends Chowdhury’s action as a ‘gesture of humanity’ for a rescued animal, accusing the BJP of using the incident to divert attention from the Indian rupee touching 90 to the dollar and the ‘worst performing currency’ crisis. Senior Journalist Neerja Chowdhury laments the ‘lack of civility’ in public discourse, urging leaders to restore parliamentary decorum. The big talking point of this episode of News Today is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi, his first since the start of the Ukraine war. The government has reversed a directive that would have mandated the pre-installation of the 'Sanchar Saathi' app on smartphones. In this special report, a panel discusses the government's decision to retract the mandatory pre-installation of a cyber security app. While the government maintains the tool is for safety, opposition representatives question the lack of privacy audits and the legality of the initial directive. The discussion also covers recent parliamentary protests regarding air pollution levels in the capital and a privilege motion controversy involving a Member of Parliament. The top focus of this episode of 5 Live is Delhi's severe air pollution crisis and how the issue is missing from the government's agenda in the ongoing Winter Session.

Environmentalist Jai Dhar Gupta strongly criticises the government's focus on dust control, stating, 'Dust has never killed anybody... we have to reduce the emissions at the source.' He highlights his personal initiative of creating a private forest and calls for a 'COVID-like national body' to monitor clean air, a suggestion also backed by Kiran Bedi. Reporter Milan Sharma provides alarming data, revealing that over 2 lakh respiratory illness cases have been reported between 2022 and 2025, with 30,000 requiring hospitalisation. The panel concludes that citizens must now lead the fight for their right to breathe. In this Special Report, Delhi Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa addresses the critical issue of air pollution linked to traffic congestion in the national capital. Speaking after a high-level meeting, Sirsa reveals, 'There are 62 traffic congestion hotspots in Delhi,' and emphasizes the need for immediate short-term measures by agencies including the Delhi Police and PWD. The report, filed by Milan Sharma, highlights that the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has directed authorities to clear illegal parking and encroachments to mitigate emissions. The Minister notes that this was the '6th meeting on air quality' involving multiple stakeholders like the Ministry of Agriculture and civic bodies. The segment also features citizen reactions to the toxic air, with some calling for the return of the odd-even scheme. In a Special Report from the Rajya Sabha, DMK MP P Wilson urges the central government to reconsider holding the Parliament Winter Session in Delhi during peak smog months. Terming the national capital a 'gas chamber', Wilson states, 'Parliament cannot sit in silence while citizens gasp for survival.' Participating in the debate on the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 2024, he highlights that Delhi residents are losing over eight years of life expectancy due to toxic air. Wilson argues that pollution is a national emergency and calls for the decongestion of Delhi by establishing regional benches of the Supreme Court in Chennai, Mumbai, and Kolkata. He also suggests moving ministries and statutory bodies to other states to spread the administrative load. The MP questions why governance in 2025 should operate as it did in 1950, emphasizing that traffic congestion and over-centralization are major culprits behind the crisis. In this special report, citizens, students, and mothers gather at Jantar Mantar to protest against the severe air pollution in the national capital. One mother shares her distress, revealing her 7-year-old child has undergone four eye surgeries due to the toxic air. The programme questions why this public health emergency fails to resonate within Parliament despite the high AQI. Experts and activists discuss the conflict between development goals and climate action, while reporters highlight the political apathy towards the crisis. Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has announced the formation of a new high-level committee to tackle the city's worsening pollution crisis. Reporting from the Delhi Secretariat, India Today correspondent Sushant Mehra confirmed the committee will be chaired by the CM herself and include experts and central government representatives. However, environmentalist Jai Dhar Gupta dismissed the move as ""too little, too late,"" arguing that Delhi already has sufficient monitoring infrastructure. He stated, 'I think we need actually it sounds like they're just biding time to Holi so that all this uproar and the emergency passes.' The report highlights the ongoing political and administrative challenges in addressing the toxic air quality in the National Capital Region, with strict instructions issued for dust control and water sprinkling. On this Special Report, the focus is on the severe air pollution crisis in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), which is forcing residents to make desperate choices. A family in Noida shares their harrowing experience, revealing that their five-year-old child required surgery for respiratory issues exacerbated by the toxic air. The parents state that doctors were shocked by the extent of the child's airway blockage, diagnosing him with enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Faced with recurring health problems and the need for heavy antibiotics, the family is now considering leaving the city permanently to protect their son. The programme highlights the growing desperation among residents as the air quality index remains in the severe category, turning the capital into a 'gas chamber' and pushing families to the brink. In a dramatic protest against the severe air pollution crisis in the national capital, Congress MP Imran Masood arrived at the Parliament House with an oxygen cylinder on Wednesday. Speaking to the media, Masood stated, 'Pradhan Mantri Ji swam ismein pahle ke desh ke SAB sabhi Prabhavit pradeshon ke Mukhyamantriyon kiye committee banaaye' (The Prime Minister himself should form a committee of Chief Ministers of all affected states). The protest follows an op-ed by Congress Parliamentary Party Chairperson Sonia Gandhi, who termed the pollution crisis a 'slow-motion tragedy' claiming 34,000 lives annually. The report also highlights a high-level meeting called by the Delhi government involving agencies like DDMA and MCD. India Today's Sushant Mehra reports on the government's response, while citizens at Jantar Mantar demand immediate action.

Paliwal notes that the opposition is demanding a discussion on the hazardous air quality in the National Capital. In this Special Report, India Today's News Editor & Anchor Sneha Mordani highlights a concerning new study by the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB). The 2025 report ranks Delhi third in the country for uranium contamination in groundwater, with levels exceeding the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) limit of 30 parts per billion. The broadcast references a recent scare in Bihar where uranium was found in breast milk, underscoring the health risks. Experts warn that uranium is 'nephrotoxic' and can cause chronic kidney disease. The report identifies North Delhi, Narela, and Kanjhawala as affected zones and suggests Reverse Osmosis (RO) as a mitigation measure. In this report from India Today, journalist Mausami Singh covers the opposition's protest against the new Labour Code outside the Makar Dwar of the Indian Parliament. Singh reports that the opposition's key objection is that 'the labor bill that the government is getting, and the labor codes are not protecting the rights of the laborers.' This demonstration follows a previous protest regarding the 'S.I.R.' (Special Intensive Revision) of electoral rolls. According to Singh, the opposition is making a broader point that they are not just stalling Parliament over a single issue. They intend to raise a host of other pertinent matters in the coming days, including pollution and national security, to counter the Prime Minister's accusation that their protests are mere 'drama'. India Today's Special Correspondent Amit Bhardwaj reports on Sonia Gandhi's latest opinion piece regarding the air pollution crisis. Gandhi terms the situation a 'slow motion public health tragedy' and cites an estimate of 34,000 annual deaths in 10 cities.

Donald Trump,"Donald J. Trump, born June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York, is an American businessman, media personality, and politician who served as the 45th President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. Trump began his career in real estate, inheriting his father's business and expanding it into a global brand known for luxury properties, hotels, and golf courses. His flair for self-promotion and bold business ventures made him a prominent figure in the 1980s and 1990s. Trump gained national fame as the host of the reality TV show ""The Apprentice,"" where his catchphrase, ""You're fired,"" became iconic. In 2015, he announced his candidacy for the presidency as a Republican, running on a platform of economic nationalism, immigration reform, and ""America First"" policies. His outsider status, unconventional campaign style, and appeal to disaffected voters led to a surprising victory in the 2016 election. During his presidency, Trump implemented tax cuts, deregulation, and a hardline stance on immigration and trade. His tenure was marked by controversy, including two impeachments. Russian President Putin said that the tariff actions by US President Donald Trump and concerns raised by Western nations over India’s Russian oil imports reflect worry about India’s rising economic influence. H-1B visas are lifelines for US tech companies that draw heavily from India and China. Many industry leaders backed Donald Trump last year, betting on a business-friendly environment even as immigration rules tightened. Ilhan Omar condemned Donald Trump after he called Somalis “garbage” who “contribute nothing.” She said his fixation is “creepy and unhealthy” as Minnesota leaders denounced the president’s escalating attacks on Somali Americans. The US Institute of Peace building now displays Donald Trump’s name after a disputed federal takeover. The White House claims it has been renamed as Trump prepares to host leaders for a US-brokered peace deal. The phone call comes against the backdrop of escalating American pressure on Venezuela, including maritime interdictions, expanded sanctions and repeated warnings from US military leaders about what they describe as state-linked criminal networks operating in the Caribbean. Trump’s proposal to weaken fuel-economy standards lowers future mileage requirements, winning industry support but drawing environmental backlash over increased emissions, higher gasoline consumption, and a retreat from Biden-era clean-transportation policies. Donald Trump posted more than 160 messages on Truth Social in a late-night blitz, prompting Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert to mock his manic Monday marathon and his exhausted appearance the next day. Donald Trump’s push for a Ukraine peace deal has accelerated, with US, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators holding quiet talks across multiple countries as new intermediaries emerge and pressure grows for a breakthrough. Trump criticised American allies Japan and South Korea for 'ripping off' the US amid global tariff discussions, highlighting long-standing trade disputes in a candid meeting. The 79-year-old president appeared to have difficulty staying awake at several points during the three-hour cabinet meeting. Trump told a Cabinet meeting he doesn’t want Somali immigrants in the US, accusing them of relying on welfare as Minnesota prepares for a federal sweep targeting Somali nationals with deportation orders. Netanyahu asked US President Donald Trump for continued support in his bid for a presidential pardon in Israel, days after formally requesting clemency from President Isaac Herzog in his corruption case. Trump declared that all Biden-era documents allegedly signed with an autopen, including pardons, are terminated, a claim with no legal basis. The move escalates his efforts to delegitimize Biden’s official actions. The US has paused all immigration applications from 19 countries after a D.C. shooting involving an Afghan national, expanding Trump’s clampdown on green cards, citizenship bids, asylum cases and visas. Trump Accounts give newborns USD 1,000 invested in the market, aiming to help children build wealth. A major Dell donation adds USD 250 for eligible low-income kids under 10 whose families open accounts. US President Trump said the two men also discussed sanctions - an apparent reference to his administration's targeting of Brazil's judiciary over the criminal case of right-wing former President Jair Bolsonaro. Trump repeated his claim of helping end the India-Pakistan conflict and joked he should receive a Nobel Prize for each of the eight wars he says he ended, while pushing for recognition on Ukraine. An Afghan national pleaded not guilty to killing a National Guard specialist and wounding another near the White House, prompting heightened political debate over immigration, federal deployments, and the motives behind the attack. The energy security drive appears to contradict the EU’s pledge under a trade deal reached in July to more than triple US fuel purchases over the next three years to USD 750 billion Venezuela’s President Maduro fails to secure US-guaranteed safe exit after Trump declines his conditions. The US intensifies pressure with sanctions and military actions, escalating tensions in the region.

If US has right to buy fuel from us...: Putin calls out Trump's hypocrisy,"Calling out Donald Trump's hypocrisy, Russian President Vladimir Putin asserted that the US continues to purchase uranium from Russia, key to producing nuclear reactor fuel, while pressuring India to stop energy imports from Moscow. In an exclusive interview with India Today, Putin, who arrived in New Delhi for a two-day visit, emphasised that India should enjoy the same privilege if the US had the right to purchase fuel from Russia. ""The US continues to buy nuclear fuel from us for their nuclear power plants. That is also fuel. Energy. This is uranium for nuclear power plants that are functioning in the US,"" Putin said in the interview ahead of his first visit to India in four years. Russia is the second-largest supplier of enriched uranium to the US, accounting for about 25% of the sales. It is expected to pocket around $1.2 billion from uranium sales to America this year. In 2024, Russia earned approximately $800 million from uranium exports to the US. Framing the issue as one of fairness and strategic balance, Putin said he would discuss the matter with Trump. ""If the US has the right to purchase fuel from us, why should India be deprived of such a right? That is a matter to be studied closely, and we are prepared to discuss that and debate that with President Trump,"" Putin underscored. Catch live updates of his visit to India'ENERGY COOPERATION UNAFFECTED BY SANCTIONS' In the interview, Putin maintained that Russia's energy partnership with India was steady and untouched by Western sanctions. ""Our energy cooperation with India remains unaffected by current conditions, fleeting political swings or indeed the tragic events in Ukraine,"" the Russian strongman asserted. Putin's pointed remarks come at a time when India has been under pressure from Trump to cut back on its imports of Russian oil. The US has claimed that it enables Russia to withstand the pressure of economic sanctions by the West and continue its war against Ukraine, which is set to enter its fourth year. In August, Trump imposed an additional tariff of 25% on India, taking the total levy to 50%, for buying Russian oil. The issue deteriorated ties between the two allies, but has been on an upswing since then. Russia accounts for 35% of India's crude oil imports, compared to 1-2% before the Ukraine war. The Ministry of External Affairs had previously called out the double standards of the US, pointing out that America continued to import uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry and palladium for EVs from Moscow.WHAT PUTIN SAID ON MODI, UKRAINE WAR During the 100-minute-long interview, Putin also praised PM Modi's leadership style and his 'Make in India' initiative, calling it a ""practical"" and powerful force shaping Russia–India cooperation. ""PM Modi is a very reliable person. India got lucky. He lives and breathes India,"" Putin said.

Russia will finish war when...: What Putin said on Ukraine conflict endgame,"Firing his shots at the West and Ukraine, the Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an exclusive interview with India Today, said that Russia did not start the Ukraine war. Rather, it was Ukraine, under the influence of the West, that involved Russia in the ongoing war. However, Russia will finish the war after achieving its goals. The India Today anchors, Anjana Om Kashyap and Geeta Mohan, then asked Putin what would be considered a victory for him? They also referred to one of his old quotes that mentioned that the country would only submit arms if Ukraine removes troops from several territories claimed by Russia. Answering this, Putin highlighted antagonisms between the two countries. He mentioned that Ukraine has harmed Russian interests by banning the Russian language in several territories and driving people away from temples, churches, and so on. The President noted that Russia is desperate to protect its interests at any cost. ""The point is that Russia is determined and will certainly do so to protect its interests, protect its people living there, protect our traditional values, the Russian language, and so on,"" Putin said to India Today. He further pointed out that Ukraine banned the Russian Orthodox Church and seized many others, and Russia is fighting to reaffirm its position on those territories. In the interview, the President left no stone unturned to foil the conspiracy hatched by the West to start a war against Russia. ""The West backed Ukraine and supported the events by orchestrating the coup d'tat. That was the point that triggered the events in Crimea, followed by developments in southeastern Ukraine, in Donbass. However, they never mention it,"" Putin noted. Putin also said that Russia tried to resolve the matter by taking the path of peace. However, it did not bear fruit, and hence, the country had no other options except to indulge in the war. The interview also touched upon the political turbulence prevailing in the Donbas region, which played a significant part in the Russia-Ukraine war. Putin blamed Ukraine for ushering in violence against the citizens living in that part. ""After eight years of relentless violence against those citizens of Donbass, something the West hasn't uttered a word about, we were forced to recognise these republics first, and secondly, provide support,"" Putin said. ""Our special military operation isn't the start of a war, but rather an attempt to end one that the West ignited using Ukrainian nationalists,"" he further added.- EndsPublished By: Priya PareekPublished On: Dec 4, 2025",real,https://www.indiatoday.in,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/russia-didnt-start-war-west-egged-ukraine-on-we-will-finish-it-when-our-goals-are-met-putin-to-india-today-2830929-2025-12-04
"Everything ends, only God eternal: Putin on viral longevity chat with Xi","Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the idea of human immortality, saying that while science can significantly extend life expectancy, “everything has an end — only God is eternal.” In an exclusive interview with India Today TV during his two-day visit to India, Putin was asked directly whether he believed immortality was achievable — a question prompted by his earlier hot-mic conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing that went viral worldwide. He was asked: “Do you think immortality is achievable?” Putin replied: “Everything has an end, only God is eternal. We can extend longevity of life, 100%. I am sure we can.” He pointed to historic gains in public health to underline his view. “77 years ago, the average lifespan of a person in India was 31 years, and now it’s about 70. That’s what healthcare does. In India, infant mortality was cut four-fold. These are all the results of healthcare efforts.” He added that advancing technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, would accelerate this progress. “If you use AI in healthcare, and if you use AI to produce drugs, it can have a tremendous effect,” Putin said, while reiterating that human life, ultimately, is finite. “Nevertheless, everything comes to an end.” The unscripted exchange took place on September 3, 2025, in Beijing, as Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un walked toward the viewing platform for a military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The private conversation was inadvertently picked up on a live feed of Chinese state media, quickly circulating worldwide. In the clip, Putin and Xi discussed life extension and human longevity. Putin later confirmed to reporters that he had addressed the topic of extending life expectancy, noting that modern medicine offers hope for a longer active life. The conversation also touched upon controversial areas, including organ transplantation, which remains a sensitive subject in China due to human rights concerns.WHY THE CLIP DREW GLOBAL ATTENTION The video captured imaginations worldwide, offering a rare glimpse into the private reflections of two of the world’s most powerful leaders. Analysts noted the contrast between the leaders’ formal public personas and their personal curiosity about science and technology, including radical life-extension possibilities. Kim Jong Un’s silent presence alongside them added further intrigue to the unexpected moment. The clip gained massive traction as it offered a rare glimpse into an informal, personal conversation between the three leaders.- EndsPublished By: Priyanka KumariPublished On: Dec 4, 2025Tune InMust Watch",real,https://www.indiatoday.in,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/everything-ends-only-god-eternal-putin-on-viral-longevity-chat-with-xi-jinping-sco-summit-china-video-2830982-2025-12-04
A handshake and a hug: PM Modi rolls out red carpet for Putin,"In a rare diplomatic gesture, Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally received Russian President Vladimir Putin with a warm hug and handshake as he arrived at Delhi's Palam Airport for a two-day state visit on Thursday evening. The gesture by PM Modi signals the significance New Delhi is attaching to the visit, Putin's first to India since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. Putin was welcomed with a cultural performance while coming out of the airport before he and PM Modi went on to share another “car moment” with the two leaders travelling together to Lok Kalyan Marg, PM's residence in Delhi. The gesture mirrored their much-talked-about joint ride in Putin’s car during the SCO Summit in Tianjin, China — an image that underscored their personal rapport and became one of the most widely circulated highlights of that meeting. Soon after receiving President Putin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared photographs of their meeting and wrote on X, “Delighted to welcome my friend, President Putin, to India. Looking forward to our interactions later this evening and tomorrow. India–Russia friendship is a time-tested one that has greatly benefitted our people.” Delighted to welcome my friend, President Putin to India.

These include:Barack Obama (USA), 2015 — Received in Delhi during his Republic Day visitSheikh Hasina (Bangladesh), 2017 — Welcomed on arrival for a bilateral visitShinzo Abe (Japan), 2017 — Received at Ahmedabad airport ahead of the India–Japan summitDonald J Trump (USA), 2020 — Welcomed at Ahmedabad airport during his India visitMohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (UAE), 2024 — Received during the Vibrant Gujarat Global SummitTamim bin Hamad Al Thani (Qatar), 2025 — Welcomed on arrival in New Delhi Putin arrived for a two-day state visit during which several agreements are expected to be signed. The visit coincides with the 25th anniversary of the India-Russia strategic partnership and marks the 23rd annual summit between the two nations. Putin is accompanied by a high-level ministerial delegation, including Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Agriculture Minister Oksana Lut, Economic Development Minister Maxim Reshetnikov, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko, Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev and Transport Minister Roman Nikitin.PM TO HOST PUTIN FOR DINNER PM Modi is hosting Putin for a private dinner tonight as both leaders look to reaffirm a partnership that has endured for nearly eight decades despite shifting global alignments and intermittent tensions. Putin’s formal engagements begin on Friday with a meeting with the President of India at Rashtrapati Bhavan, likely around 11 am. He is then expected to visit Rajghat to pay tribute at Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial before proceeding to Hyderabad House, where the core bilateral talks will be held. PM Modi will also host a working lunch for the Russian president around 2 pm, after which structured delegation-level discussions will review ongoing cooperation and identify new areas of partnership. In the evening, President Droupadi Murmu will host a state banquet in Putin’s honour before he departs for Moscow.EXPECTED OUTCOMES FROM THE VISIT Government sources said the visit is poised to significantly deepen economic cooperation, with Putin accompanied by a sizeable delegation of business leaders. India is focusing on reducing its widening trade deficit with Russia by expanding Indian exports — particularly in pharmaceuticals, automobiles, agricultural goods and marine products. Officials said improved access to Russian markets could generate new opportunities for Indian companies, boost employment and support farming incomes. Several agreements and MoUs are expected across shipping, healthcare, fertilisers and connectivity, along with expanded collaboration in mobility partnerships, culture, people-to-people exchanges and scientific research.- EndsPublished By: Ajmal Published On: Dec 4, 2025Tune InMust Watch",real,https://www.indiatoday.in,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pm-modi-to-receive-vladimir-putin-at-delhi-airport-in-rare-diplomatic-gesture-sources-2830738-2025-12-04
IndiGo cites pilot shortage for mass flight cancellations; seeks relaxation,"Low-cost flight carrier IndiGo has told the Civil Aviation Ministry that its ongoing wave of cancellations is primarily the result of a pilot shortage compounded by winter-schedule pressures, and has sought partial relaxations in the new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms to stabilise operations. The disclosure came during a review meeting called by Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu after disruptions intensified across the airline’s network, causing chaos across major airports. According to officials, the airline told the ministry that the new FDTL rules, which tighten rest requirements and limit duty hours, have added to resource strain at a time when the carrier is facing a crunch in cockpit crew availability. Naidu also convened a separate meeting with senior officers of the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and directed them to instruct all airport directors to closely monitor the situation and ensure full support for stranded passengers, including assistance at terminals. The minister further asked the DGCA to keep a close watch on airfares during the period of disruptions to prevent undue escalation of ticket prices.SUBMISSIONS MADE BY INDIGO TO MOCA AND DGCA According to ministry sources, IndiGo has formally submitted the following points to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA):The airline is facing significant transitional challenges in crew rostering and availability under the Phase-2 FDTL requirements.These issues, compounded by winter operational constraints, have led to the sharp rise in cancellations and delays.To minimise passenger inconvenience while maintaining safety margins, IndiGo has sought operational variations/exemptions from: Para 3.11 (Definition of Night Duty), and Para 6.1.4 (operations encroaching night duty), for A320 operations up to 10 February 2026.IndiGo has assured the DGCA that corrective actions are underway and “normalised and stable operations” will be fully restored by 10 February 2026.The airline has also acknowledged that:The disruptions stemmed from misjudgment and planning gaps in implementing Phase-2 of the FDTL CAR, admitting that actual crew requirements were higher than anticipated.More cancellations are expected for the next 2–3 days as part of schedule stabilisation.From December 8, IndiGo will reduce flight operations to minimise disruption while restoring order. The DGCA has asked IndiGo to submit the specific FDTL relaxations it requires to normalise operations, for regulatory review.DGCA DIRECTIONS TO INDIGO Following the review, the DGCA issued a set of directives to the airline:Roadmap submission: IndiGo must provide a detailed roadmap on crew recruitment aligned with aircraft induction plans.Training and safety planning: The airline must present a plan for crew training, roster restructuring, safety-risk assessments, and mitigation measures ensuring full compliance.Mitigation plan for current disruptions: IndiGo must outline immediate actions to stabilise flights and ensure a progressive reduction in cancellations.Fortnightly progress reports: A comprehensive report every 15 days, detailing operational improvements, crew levels, and roster stability.FDTL relaxation proposal: IndiGo must formally submit the FDTL exemptions required for normalisation, which the DGCA will evaluate. The regulator will continue strict, real-time monitoring of IndiGo’s network performance, restoration efforts, and passenger-handling measures in the coming week.- EndsPublished By: Ajmal Published On: Dec 4, 2025Must Watch",real,https://www.indiatoday.in,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/cancellations-due-to-pilot-crunch-indigo-tells-government-seeks-partial-relaxation-of-flight-duty-time-rules-2830901-2025-12-04
"But India is 3rd in purchasing power: Putin shades G7, rules out Russia G8 return","Russian President Vladimir Putin said the G7 no longer reflects the world’s economic balance, arguing that Europe is slipping into recession while emerging powers such as India now play a far larger role. In an exclusive interview with India Today during his two-day visit to New Delhi, Putin said forums like Brics and the G20 — where India is a core member — have become more relevant than the Western-led G7. Putin, who stressed that he had stopped attending G8 meetings long before the fallout over Ukraine, said the grouping has failed to keep pace with shifts in global economic weight. Asked whether Russia wished to rejoin what was once the G8, he responded with an unequivocal ""no"", adding that his position on the matter had not changed for years. ""At a certain point in time, I simply stopped going to these meetings,"" he said, noting that the decision pre-dated the Ukraine conflict. He said he effectively stepped back after Russia's 2012 presidential election and returned only occasionally thereafter. He also clarified that his recent conversation with US President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff did not involve any formal proposal for Russia to re-enter the group. ""There was no proposal,"" he said.PUTIN CHALLENGES G7's RELEVANCEPutin also questioned the idea that the G7 still represents the world’s leading economic powers. He mocked the label itself, noting that in Russian the letter ""G"" is associated with the word for ""great"" or ""big"", and argued that several major economies are now outside the club. PUTIN CHALLENGES G7's RELEVANCE Putin also questioned the idea that the G7 still represents the world’s leading economic powers. He mocked the label itself, noting that in Russian the letter ""G"" is associated with the word for ""great"" or ""big"", and argued that several major economies are now outside the club. He pointed to India’s position in global rankings by purchasing power, noting that it stands third in the world, ahead of some G7 members. By contrast, he said, countries such as the United Kingdom now rank much lower on that measure. While stressing that G7 states still have ""a high-tech economy with a very solid foundation"", he said that their position is eroding. He cited recession in Germany ""for the third year in a row"" and described France as ""on the brink of recession"", adding that other leading European economies are also under strain. This, he said, was happening ""due to the erroneous policy pursued by the authorities of many of these countries"". Even so, he stopped short of dismissing the grouping outright. ""The G7 is still an important platform. They are working on something, discussing things, making some decisions. Good health to them and all the best,"" he said.PUTIN BACKS BRICS, SCO AND G20 OVER G7 Putin dismissed the G7 as outdated, pointing instead to Brics, the SCO and the G20 as arenas where Russia is a full participant and where today’s geopolitical balance is more faithfully represented. ""Other big associations are coming up, like Brics, the SCO. And the G20 is still active and we are participating in all of these formats,"" he said, adding that Moscow has ""no objections"" to working through these platforms. He brushed aside speculation that Western outreach might bring Russia back to a G8 setup, saying there is no compelling reason to return. Putin also took aim at US behaviour, stating Donald Trump criticises India’s energy ties with Moscow even as the United States keeps purchasing Russian uranium. The Russian President also praised PM Modi's leadership, calling the relationship one of deep trust. ""We have very trustworthy and friendly relations.

Putin says Trump's tariff stance reflects fear of India's economic rise,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that some global powers are uncomfortable with India’s growing strength in world markets, especially as New Delhi continues to buy Russian oil despite Western pressure. In an exclusive interview with India Today, Putin suggested that recent tariff actions by US President Donald Trump and concerns raised by Western nations over India’s Russian oil imports reflect worry about India’s rising economic influence. Putin’s remarks come as the United States and European partners step up enforcement of the Russian oil price cap. They have also issued new warnings to countries, including India, about dealing with sanctioned tankers and intermediaries. Despite these moves, Putin stressed that India–Russia energy ties remain stable. He said the recent pressure was political rather than based on supply and demand. “The issue here is that the pressure you have referred to typically involves employing political instruments to influence normal competition,” Putin said. He added that the energy partnership between the two countries has a long foundation and is not shaped by short-term events. “Our energy cooperation with India remains unaffected by current conditions, fleeting political swings, or indeed the tragic events in Ukraine,” he said. Putin explained that Russian oil companies and Indian refiners had built a strong working relationship well before the Ukraine conflict. He pointed to a major Russian investment in an Indian refinery, calling it one of the largest foreign inflows into the country at more than 20 billion US dollars. This refinery has grown over the years and helped India become a major supplier of refined products to Europe. “It took years to achieve and is in no way connected to the current economic environment,” he said, noting that India’s rise in this space has caused discomfort among some players. “Certain actors clearly dislike India's growing role in international markets owing to its ties with Russia. Consequently, they are seeking means to constrain India's influence for political reasons by imposing artificial obstacles.” Putin also spoke about India–China relations and said both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping understand the risks of rising tension. “Both Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping see that some specific tension is rising, and they both try to find solutions to these issues, exerting maximum effort,” he said. He added that Russia views their efforts with respect and does not intend to interfere. “At the same time, Russia does not feel entitled to intervene, because these are your bilateral affairs.”- EndsPublished By: Priya PareekPublished On: Dec 4, 2025Must Watch",real,https://www.indiatoday.in,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/certain-actors-dislike-indias-growing-role-in-markets-owing-to-russia-ties-putins-dig-at-trump-tariffs-2830908-2025-12-04

"Our energy cooperation with India remains unaffected, says Vladimir Putin","Russia’s energy partnership with India remains steady and untouched by the latest Western sanctions, President Vladimir Putin told India Today in an exclusive interview. His comments come at a time when the United States and European partners have tightened enforcement of their price cap on Russian oil and issued fresh cautions to countries, including India, about dealing with sanctioned tankers and intermediaries. Putin, however, played down the impact of these moves and said attempts to influence India’s oil purchases were political in nature rather than grounded in market realities. “The pressure you have referred to typically involves employing political instruments to influence normal competition,” he said. Putting the focus firmly on India, he added that the foundation of the bilateral energy relationship was strong enough to withstand shifting geopolitical winds. “Our energy cooperation with India remains unaffected by current conditions, fleeting political swings or indeed the tragic events in Ukraine,” he said. Putin then highlighted the depth of the hydrocarbons partnership and its long-standing commercial roots. “Regarding hydrocarbons, well before the Ukrainian situation, our business entities had already built a solid and efficient commercial relationship that is based on mutual trust. It is widely known that one of our leading companies acquired an oil refinery in India,” he said, referring to Rosneft’s stake in Nayara Energy. He said that this investment was not minor or symbolic. “This investment represented one of the largest foreign inflows into the Indian economy, totalling 20 billion US dollars. Our company has been continuously expanding the operations of this refinery, working with its partners and operating successfully year after year,” Putin said. According to him, the India–Russia value chain in energy has matured to the point where its impact goes beyond bilateral trade. “As a result, India has become one of the major refined product suppliers to Europe. Not just because it buys our oil at a discount. It took years to achieve and is in no way connected to the economic environment,” he said. Putin also suggested that India’s growing influence in global energy markets is not viewed positively by all. “Certain actors clearly dislike India’s role in international markets, owing to its ties with Russia. Consequently, they are seeking means to constrain India’s influence for political reasons by imposing artificial obstacles,” he said. These comments gain significance because recent US and EU actions have complicated global shipping routes for Russian crude and raised concerns about whether India’s imports will face disruption. Putin made clear that Moscow sees no threat to this partnership and will continue supplying India as usual. He also reiterated that the energy bond between the two countries did not emerge because of sanctions or temporary price advantages. It is, he insisted, the continuation of a commercial relationship that predates the Ukraine conflict and is supported by strategic trust. Putin noted that his personal rapport with Prime Minister Narendra Modi has helped maintain stability in the relationship despite external pressure. He said this trust ensures that cooperation in critical sectors like energy continues without disruption. In India’s context, Russian oil remains crucial for controlling domestic fuel prices and meeting rising demand. Putin’s message signals that, regardless of evolving Western sanctions, Russia expects no interruption in its energy ties with India and views the relationship as long-term, predictable, and built on shared economic interests.- EndsPublished By: Koustav DasPublished On: Dec 4, 2025",real,https://www.indiatoday.in,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/russia-india-oil-energy-ties-unaffected-vladimir-putin-exclusive-interview-india-today-2830933-2025-12-04
Couldn't live up to promise: IndiGo CEO apologises over chaos in letter to staff,"IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers on Thursday apologised after hundreds of flights were cancelled and delayed, leading to massive chaos at airports across cities over the last three days. In an internal email to staff, now viral on social media, Elbers admitted that the company could not live up to the promise to the flyers. ""We serve close to 380,000 customers a day and want each of them to have a good experience. We could not live up to that promise these past days and we have publicly apologised for that,"" he said. In the internal email, Elbert further mentioned a set of challenges that impacted the flyer's performance in the last 48 years. He also expressed his gratitude to ""all of his colleagues"" who were at the operational end, including the pilots, cabin crews, engineers, and several others. ""An accumulation of several operational challenges, including minor technology glitches, schedule changes, adverse weather conditions, heightened congestion in the aviation ecosystem, and the implementation of the FDTL norms, compounded negatively to create a cascading impact on our operations,"" he wrote. ""I would like to express gratitude and appreciation to all the colleagues in operations..."" he further noted. IndiGo, one of the largest carriers in the country, is grappling with significant operational disruptions in the past few days, and more than 300 flights were cancelled on Thursday, while scores of flights were delayed. In November, the airline witnessed the cancellation of 1,232 flights and severe delays in many flights. Following the drop in performance, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), decided to launch a probe. It asked the airline to cite reasons behind the drastic decline in operations. In response to this, the carrier noted that out of those 1,232 flights, 755 were cancelled because of staff shortages, 92 were cancelled due to the failure in Air Traffic Control (ATC), 258 were cancelled due to airport restrictions, and 127 were cancelled for other reasons. It also sought a two-day period to fix everything and normalise operations. It also said that it initiated calibrated measures.

"‘Modi govt cut off funds, yet…’: How Mamata pitched her performance cardThe BJP dismissed the Trinamool Congress government's report card as lies, deepening the battle-lines for competing narratives in the run-up to West Bengal elections","On December 2, the corridors of Nabanna in Kolkata briefly felt less like a government office and more like a stage. The spotlight turned towards the ruling Trinamool Congress’s (TMC) decade-and-a-half hold on power as a voice—of National Award-winning singer Iman Chakraborty—rose through the hall in the form of a specially composed panchali, a traditional narrative ballad celebrating West Bengal’s journey under the TMC. The setting was unmistakably administrative, yet the mood carried the cinematic flair of an election season officially underway. It was here, at the state secretariat, that chief minister Mamata Banerjee unveiled ‘Unnayaner Panchali’, her government’s elaborate performance report, as the state prepares for the 2026 assembly polls amidst the Election Commission’s (EC) ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. Mamata seized the moment to level a sharp accusation against the Centre, claiming that the BJP-led government was starving Bengal of critical funds. “The central government has withheld our long-pending dues—Rs 1,87,000 crore. When will they pay?” she demanded. “Elections are nearing but development works in Bengal can’t be stopped. Hope, they will release the funds.” Mamata stressed that in spite of what she called political obstruction, the state had continued topping the charts in key welfare infrastructure. “Before the Centre withheld money, West Bengal topped the country in MGNREGA (rural job security), rural housing and village road construction four times in a row,” she said. Even under fiscal strain, she pointed out, her administration had spent Rs 1 lakh crore on Khadya Saathi, benefiting 90 million people, and Rs 1,717 crore on Duare Ration, for 70 million beneficiaries. Mamata projected her governance model as a mix of accelerated economic progress and expansive social protection. “More than 20 million jobs have already been generated in the state during the past 14 years, and an additional 10 million will be created in future,” she said. “Six economic corridors are under construction. We have reduced unemployment by 40 per cent in our state.” Investments worth Rs 2 lakh crore have flowed in since 2011 (when TMC assumed power), she added. Women—the TMC’s most-crucial constituency—remain at the forefront of the narrative. Speaking about Lakshmi Bhandar, Mamata declared: “We are giving a monthly Rs 1,000 to every woman, and Rs 1,200 for those from the SC/ST category. The scheme is lifelong for women. In all, 22.1 million women get the social security benefit.” In a pointed comparison with BJP-ruled Bihar, she said, “They have given a one-time fund of Rs 10,000.” Later, Mamata drew the same arc of achievement in a lengthy post on X, framing Bengal’s political and developmental story as a conscious choice its people made. “Bengal has travelled a long and determined path shaped by the trust of our people and the conviction that development must reach every household, every neighbourhood, every region and every corner of our state,” she wrote. “This is the collective journey of a people who chose progress over prejudice, humanity over hostility, and unity over divisiveness,” she posted, adding that each of her government’s initiative showed the intent that “Bengal’s progress must be broad-based, equitable and sustainable”. Mamata’s post repeated her sharpest grievance: “Despite the Centre withholding Bengal’s dues out of sheer vindictiveness, we have ensured that people’s rights and entitlements are protected.” She listed Kanyashree, Swasthya Saathi, Khadyasaathi, Krishak Bandhu, Duare Sarkar, Karmashree, Banglar Bari among programmes that “safeguard the future of our people”. Even the narrative medium—the modern panchali—was symbolic. “Rooted in Bengal’s soil, language and cultural consciousness, the panchali form has always carried our shared memory and heritage,” she wrote. “In this modern panchali, every verse echoes the transformative journey of our Maa, Mati, Manush.” At Nabanna, Mamata also sought to address the strain on state employees from the SIR process, announcing a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each for the families of some 40 booth-level officers (BLOs) and staff who reportedly died while on duty, including cases of death by suicide. She said 13 others, including three BLOs, who fell critically ill during the SIR exercise would be given Rs 1 lakh each. As Mamata directed officials to accelerate pending works before the model code of conduct for assembly elections kicks in, she also signed off her social media message with a note of gratitude and a political promise: “Your blessings and affection have been our greatest strength and the driving force behind every step of progress. Together, we will continue to write new chapters of growth, equality and hope that reverberate for decades to come.” The BJP countered swiftly. Senior party leader Rahul Sinha alleged Mamata was focused only on “votes, not security” while leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari accused her of “telling lies to the people”. With the battle-lines drawn and both sides ready with competing narratives, the 2026 election show has only just begun.

Indigo flight Cancellation,"Subscribe Now! Get features like Indigo Flight Cancellation: IndiGo cancelled at least 150 flights on Wednesday, triggering chaotic scenes at major airports across India as the carrier’s struggles to adapt to stringent new crew rostering rules meant even minor operational disruptions snowballed into a full-blown crisis that stranded thousands of passengers. The airline apologised for the crippling disruption and warned travellers to brace for further cancellations through Friday, saying it had initiated “calibrated adjustments” to stabilise operations over the next 48 hours. “We acknowledge that IndiGo’s operations have been significantly disrupted across the network for the past two days, and we sincerely apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused,” an airline spokesperson said, attributing the debacle to a confluence of factors including technology glitches, adverse weather, increased congestion and the implementation of updated Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) that came into force in November. Also read: IndiGo apologises after over 150 flights cancelled, shares update on resolution The immediate trigger, however, was an emergency Airbus A320 software patch rushed through over the weekend of November 29-30 that disrupted crew scheduling just as the airline was operating with minimal slack due to the FDTL rules. Data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) shows the airline had already been under strain, having cancelled 1,232 flights in November—755 of them attributed to FDTL issues—with on-time performance dropping to 67.70% from 84.1% in October. Compounding the aviation chaos, IndiGo’s baggage systems at Delhi’s Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 encountered problems on Wednesday. “While the issue at T3 was minor, T1 faced severe issues starting at around 1.30pm and going up to around 6pm,” a government official said, adding that the baggage system had trouble providing information. The airline did not comment on this aspect but several passengers stated ground crews were unavailable. Also read: DGCA probes IndiGo flight disruption; asks airline to submit reasons, mitigation plans Turmoil erupted at airports in across the country with scenes of mounting passenger anger. At least 67 flights were cancelled at Delhi airport (37 departures and 30 arrivals), 42 at Bengaluru, 40 at Hyderabad (19 departures and 21 arrivals) and 33 at Mumbai (17 departures and 16 arrivals), according to airport officials. Social media was flooded with videos showing frustrated passengers remonstrating with airline staff. IndiGo flyers across the country had similar experiences, with flights simply scrapped as they turned up to check in. “We’ve been told that there’s a flight only after 5.30am on Thursday. We don’t stay in Delhi and they have not given us any accommodation,” said 76-year-old Gautam Patil in Delhi, who spent 40 hours travelling from Chicago with his 73-year-old wife, and were due to fly to Ahmedabad. Many said they missed onward connections. “I lost two connecting flights to Kochi because of this,” said Neha Mulay in Pune, who was set to travel on a Bengaluru-bound flight at 5.55am before it was delayed for four hours and then cancelled. Mohil Manish Shah, one of the passengers who travelled from Delhi to Mumbai in 6E-664 on Monday, said his flight was delayed for five hours and the airline staff kept the passengers uninformed. “When I reached Gate 34 at 5:45 pm, the gate agents informed me the flight was delayed by 15 minutes. This message kept repeating without any transparency. When passengers sought clarity, a customer representative stated one crew member had been called off at the last minute. We were then informed that the boarding would commence at 7.30pm. We were loaded onto buses to board the aircraft but had to wait in it for 30 minutes. The flight finally took off at 9.46pm.” Shah said he had to miss an important event due to the delay, for which he had paid a higher fare. The perfect storm According to people aware of the matter, the carrier has been beset by an acute pilot shortage since new FDTL norms were implemented in two phases on July 1 and November 1. The rules, designed to combat fatigue and boost rest periods, mandate increased weekly rest periods to 48 hours, extension of night hours, and limiting the number of night landings to two, down from six earlier. While the carrier had been managing the tighter crew constraints, people quoted above said the situation cascaded into crisis after the emergency Airbus software patch. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency issued an emergency airworthiness directive affecting approximately 6,000 A320-family aircraft globally after a JetBlue flight experienced an altitude drop on October 30, injuring passengers. In India, 200 of IndiGo’s 366 operational A320-family aircraft required the urgent software update. Though the airline completed the work and claimed “zero cancellations” at the time, a former airline official said the patch “did not lead to flight cancellations on Saturday but definitely delayed flights, causing expiry of the FDTL”. The official added that adverse weather around Chennai due to Cyclone Fengal on Sunday prevented the situation from improving. “The urgent safety mandate on A320 aircraft did not lead to flight cancellations on Saturday but definitely delayed flights, causing expiry of the FDTL. Moreover, airspace around Chennai had some impact on Sunday as well, not allowing the situation to get better,” the official said. The DGCA said on Wednesday it was investigating the situation and had summoned IndiGo to its headquarters “to present the facts leading to the current situation along with plans to mitigate the ongoing delays and cancellations”. Single-fleet strategy becomes Achilles heel The crisis has laid bare a critical vulnerability in IndiGo’s core business strategy. The airline has built its success on operating an almost exclusively Airbus A320-family fleet, a single-type approach that delivers cost savings through streamlined pilot training, simplified maintenance, reduced spare parts inventory and enormous bulk-purchase discounts and has been instrumental in helping IndiGo capture more than 60% of India’s domestic market. But when the Airbus emergency directive required more than half of IndiGo’s operational fleet to be taken in for urgent maintenance, the airline had no alternative aircraft types to deploy, unlike rivals such as Air India which operate diverse fleets including Boeing 737, 777s and 787s. The single-fleet strategy, long lauded as IndiGo’s competitive advantage, had turned into a single point of failure. IndiGo, which is known for its punctuality, recorded an on-time performance score of just 35% on Tuesday, according to official data—the lowest of all Indian airlines and a precipitous drop from the airline’s typical 80%-plus performance at major Indian airports. Wednesday’s figure would only be available on Thursday. The airline, which operates around 2,200-2,300 flights daily to over 90 domestic and 45 international destinations, said its teams were “working around the clock to ease customer discomfort and ensure operations stabilise as quickly as possible”. IndiGo said affected customers were being offered alternate travel arrangements to reach their destinations or refunds, as applicable. The airline requested customers to check the latest flight status at its website before heading to the airport. As of December 2, IndiGo had a total of 416 aircraft in its fleet, with 366 in operations and 50 on ground, up from 47 the previous month, according to aircraft fleet tracking website Planespotter.net. The Airline Pilots Association of India, which represents over 800 pilots, criticised what it called “a failure of proactive resource planning” by dominant airlines. “Despite sufficient time being accorded, most airlines started preparing rather late, failing to properly adjust crew rosters 15 days in advance as required,” the association said in a statement, suggesting the crisis pointed to “an initial managerial underestimation or delay in the strategic planning necessary to provision crew accordingly”.",real,https://www.hindustantimes.com,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/150-indigo-flights-cancelled-as-roster-norms-rock-airline-101764788735286.html
Virat Kohli,"Subscribe Now! Get features like Virat Kohli informed the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) that he will be available for the upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy, marking his return to India’s domestic one-day tournament after a gap of 15 years. The decision, or rather, a change of mind, comes just a couple of days after his post-match comments in Ranchi about not needing additional preparation before international matches reportedly displeased the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). DDCA officials confirmed Kohli’s availability, saying it reflected the senior batter’s continued commitment to the game. ""Virat has confirmed his availability for the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He will be playing matches at the Centre of Excellence"". Delhi open their campaign against Andhra Pradesh in Alur on December 24. Kohli’s change of heart follows his remarks after scoring a match-winning 135 in the second ODI against South Africa on Sunday. “I’ve never been a big believer in a lot of preparation, if that makes sense. All my cricket has been mental. As long as I feel good mentally, I can play the game,” he had said, adding that the volume of cricket he has played over nearly two decades meant he did not feel the need to seek additional match practice. “I’ve played 300-odd ODI games and so much cricket over the last 15-16 years. If you can bat an hour and a half, two hours in the nets without taking a break, you’re meeting all the markers. I understand if there’s a dip in form, you look for games and try to get that form back,” Kohli said. He also stressed that for him, the focus remained on readiness rather than repetitions. “As long as you’re hitting the ball well and you’re playing good cricket, at this stage with the experience that I have, for me it’s about being physically fit, mentally ready and excited to play the games that I’m playing. Everything else should take care of itself.” According to a report in The Indian Express, Kohli's comments “had not gone down well” with the board, which had earlier instructed both Kohli and Rohit Sharma to participate in the domestic one-day competition to remain in contention for India’s ODI plans heading into the next phase of international cricket. Rohit had already informed the Mumbai Cricket Association of his availability, while Kohli had kept his decision pending until now. Kohli’s return to the domestic circuit comes at a time when speculation around the long-term ODI futures of both senior batters—Kohli, 37, and Rohit, 38—has been intensifying, especially with the next 50-over World Cup scheduled for 2027. Kohli, however, is showing no signs of slowing down. He registered back-to-back ODI centuries against South Africa to send a loud and clear message about his fitness and form.",real,https://www.hindustantimes.com,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/virat-kohli-changed-his-mind-after-bcci-expressed-displeasure-over-his-public-comments-in-ranchi-report-101764756016640.html

‘Modi not one to give in to pressure’: Putin praises PM's stance on US tariffs,"Subscribe Now! Get features like Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on a high-profile visit to India, has asserted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “is not one to give in to pressure”, such as that from the US in the form of tariffs for Delhi's oil business with Moscow. “India is a great power; not an English or British colony,” Putin said in an interview with India Today just hours before he landed at Delhi's Palam airport where Modi personally received him. Putin stressed on the historical India-Russia defense and trade relations. He also noted that over 90% of transactions between them are now in their national currencies. That means less pressure of the US dollar. He was asked specifically about the US and the West using sanctions to try and halt India-Russia oil trade in particular. “The world has seen that it cannot talk to India the way it used to 77 years ago,” he said, referring to India having gained its independence from the British raj in 1947, “India is a great power; not an English or British colony, and everyone will have to take that into account.” Watch | PM Modi welcomes Russia's Putin with a hug at Delhi's Palam airport On this count, Putin spoke specifically about PM Modi. “Prime Minister Modi is not someone who succumbs to pressure easily. The Indian people can certainly take pride in their leader. This is absolutely obvious. His stance is unwavering and straightforward, without being confrontational. Our goal is not to provoke conflict; rather, we aim to protect our lawful rights. India does the same,"" Putin said. He also noted that his relationship with PM Modi is both professional and personal. “Our collaborative endeavours carry significant weight because they transcend our mutual ties,” he said, "" PM Modi sets very challenging tasks for the country – and for himself in the first place, then for the administration, and eventually for the nation,"" he said. He highlighted Modi's call for indigenous manufacturing: “Take, for example, his famous pitch, ‘Make in India’. It has a practical dimension, including for our bilateral relations.” ""When we meet, he always says, 'Let's do this, let's do that, let's look at this area and that.' I can list them all. Therefore, we have a lot of practical areas of cooperation,"" he added. Speaking further about Modi's commitment, Putin said it's evident that the PM loves his country: “He lives and breathes India.” He termed India “lucky” for having Modi as PM. He also emphasised the seven-decade history of partnership between Russia and India. ""The global configuration is changing, with new centres of power emerging. And the global power landscape is changing too. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure stability among major nations, since this forms the groundwork for gradual progress in both bilateral and international relations,"" he said. ""I also want to highlight that India's progress over the past 77 years since gaining independence , an extremely brief span in historical terms, has been substantial indeed, and India has truly come a long way in development,"" he said. To a question, Putin spoke about his rather informal car ride with PM Modi during the SCO Summit in China in September. “This wasn't prearranged; we simply stepped out, and my car was waiting. I asked, ‘Would you like to come along?’ That's all there is to it — a gesture of human solidarity, camaraderie, and friendship. No hidden scheme was involved,” he smiled. “We climbed into the car like old friends and talked en route. We always have things to discuss. What's more, we continued our conversation and just remained in the car. Eventually, I suggested, 'Let's go, they are already waiting for us.',” he added. Putin who on his first visit to India in four years, was given a traditional welcome with a cultural dance at the airport, following which the two leaders departed in the same vehicle.

Maoism may be eradicated before March 2026 deadline: Chhattisgarh CM at HTLS,"Subscribe Now! Get features like Maoism may be eradicated in India before the deadline of March 31, 2026 and former rebels who have surrendered will not be returning to the jungles because of robust rehabilitation programmes, Chhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai said on Thursday, underlining the government’s resolve to end what was once the country’s biggest internal security challenge. Speaking in an online session at the 23rd Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Sai also spoke about the development programmes initiated by his government, how the local administration was reclaiming control of the last remaining red bastions and a planned, stringent, anti-conversion law. “Naxalism was the biggest impediment to development in Chhattisgarh. Since our government came to power on December 13, 2023, our government launched an intensive crackdown under the double engine government. Our Prime Minister has already set a target of March 31, 2026. Our jawans are motivated and have taken the fight to the Naxals,” he said. “So far, 487 Naxals, including their top cadres, have already been neutralised. The surrenders and arrests numbers are also high. We are confident that the target will be met. For now the deadline is March 31, 2026 but it may be achieved before that,” he added. His comments came amid a months-long fierce onslaught by security forces against Maoists that has seen multiple encounters, the deaths of top figures such as Madvi Hidma and Basavaraju, and hundreds of cadres laying down arms every other day. On Tuesday itself, 12 Maoists were killed in an encounter that also saw three police personnel losing their lives. “Only recently, around 38 Naxals surrendered. Many among them were those with rewards of ₹8 lakh. Our rehabilitation policy is yielding results. More than 2,336 Naxals have surrendered, 1,853 were arrested. To those surrendering, we are giving an aid of ₹10,000 a month for the first three years and skill training for their rehabilitation. Recently in Jagdalpur, a cafe run by surrendered Maoists has opened. Many people are visiting the cafe. The response is good. In rural areas, we are also giving him one hectare land for farming. In urban areas, there is a provision for their shelter. Those Maoists who had rewards on their heads, there is a provision to ensure that they receive the money after the surrender,” he said. In areas that were controlled by Maoists for decades, the government is building roads, bringing electricity, schools and other amenities, Sai said. “Ending LWE violence is not enough. We have to bring in development too. This is why we have the Niyad Nellanar Yojana. Under this we are connecting all remote villages to the mainstream. Ration cards are being made so that people there avail all benefits. I want to tell you that last year we held the Bastar Olympics for the youth of Bastar. This time, nearly 4 lakh people have come. At the completion of the Bastar Olympics on December 13, home minister Amit Shah is likely to come. There is a scope for tourism too in such a place. Home stays will be promoted,” the chief minister added. The CM also announced that the government is introducing a new, stringent, anti-conversion law. “There is a law in place but there is a need to make it more stringent. I am confident that the bill will come up in the assembly session between December 14 and 17 where it will be supported and passed. Our country is secular but if anyone takes advantage of a person’s circumstances, conditions and indulge in conversion then that is incorrect. It should be condemned. Because such crimes are happening despite the existing law in place, there is a need to make it stringent,” he said. Sai also announced that one of the main accused in the multi-crore Mahadev betting app case was detained recently. On November 6, HT reported how Ravi Uppal, co-founder of the Mahadev Online Book App and who, along with Sourabh Chandrakar, allegedly created an illegal betting empire worth several thousand crore rupees, had fled to an “unknown location. “The people behind this app have cheated our people.

"IndiGo admits planning gaps behind roster chaos, says ops to restore by Feb 10","Subscribe Now! Get features like New Delhi: IndiGo has acknowledged that the airline’s operational disruptions and flight cancellations stemmed from misjudgment and planning gaps in implementing the second phase of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) rules. It has requested time until February 10 to fully stabilise operations. The acknowledgement came as civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu reviewed the disruptions and cancellations with officials from his ministry and IndiGo. In a statement, the ministry said Indigo has been directed to normalise the operations at the earliest and ensure that it does not lead to an increase in fares. It added that the situation was being closely monitored. The statement said Naidu met senior officers of the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and instructed them to inform all airport directors to constantly monitor the situation and provide all support to stranded passengers. “The minister also directed DGCA [Directorate General of Civil Aviation] to closely monitor the airfares during the flight disruptions/cancellations,” the statement said. DGCA director general Faiz Ahmed Kidwai separately met the senior leadership of IndiGo over operational disruptions reported across the airline’s network since late November. Also Read: Over 300 IndiGo flights cancelled, CEO blames ‘accumulation’ of issues in internal email The ministry said IndiGo presented data on cancellations and provided reasons, including transitional challenges in implementing the revised FDTL CAR, crew-planning issues, and winter-season operational constraints, for the disruptions. The revised FDTL norms were implemented in two phases on July 1 and November 1, pursuant to court directions, the statement said. It added that these norms are aimed at strengthening fatigue management and ensuring enhanced flight safety. In its submissions to the DGCA, IndiGo said it is facing significant transitional challenges in roster planning and crew availability under second-phase FDTL requirements. IndiGo assured DGCA that corrective actions were underway and that normalised and stable operations would be fully restored by February 10. The government said that the airline acknowledged that the disruptions had arisen primarily from misjudgment and planning gaps in implementing the second phase of the FDTL rules. The airline accepted that the actual crew requirement for the new CAR exceeded their anticipation. The airline told the government that more cancellations will continue for the next 2-3 days as part of schedule stabilisation efforts. From December 8, the airline will reduce its flights. Also Read: Another bomb threat hits IndiGo: Hyderabad-bound plane diverted to Mumbai, 2nd incident in one day The airline’s requirement for pilot in command (PIC) was 2,186 in October. With the implementation of the new norms in November, this requirement increased to 2,422. The airline told the government that it has 2,357 PIC as of December 2025. The airline’s requirement for first officers (FO) in October was 1,948. With the revision, it increased to 2153. IndiGo has 2194 co-pilots or FOs as of December this year. The sharp increase in duty share during night-time operations has constrained crew availability, the airline said. The DGCA has directed its regional offices to conduct real-time field inspections at major airports to evaluate IndiGo’s management of flight disruptions, with focus on passenger-handling arrangements, crew-deployment and rostering practices, and on-ground coordination during delays and cancellations. A DGCA team inspected Delhi Airport Terminal 1, which faced the highest passenger impact. “The team observed that IndiGo’s passenger-handling manpower was inadequate to manage disruption-induced crowding. The airline has been instructed to urgently increase manpower and strengthen passenger-support services at all affected terminals,” the statement said. The regulator has directed the airline to submit a detailed roadmap covering projected crew recruitment. The airline has been instructed to plan for crew training, roster restructuring, safety-risk assessments, and mitigation measures leading to full compliance with immediate effect. The airline has been asked to outline immediate steps to stabilise operations and ensure a progressive reduction in cancellations. “A detailed progress report must be submitted every 15 days, covering operational improvements, crew availability, and roster stability,” the statement said. IndiGo has been directed to submit the FDTL relaxations required to normalise the flight operations for DGCA review. “DGCA will continue to maintain strict, real-time monitoring of IndiGo’s network performance, restoration efforts, and passenger-handling measures over the coming week,” the statement said.",real,https://www.hindustantimes.com,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indigo-admits-planning-gaps-behind-roster-chaos-seeks-time-till-feb-10-to-stabilise-101764866153378.html
"300 IndiGo flights cancelled, CEO blames ‘accumulation’ of issues in staff email","Subscribe Now! Get features like IndiGo has blamed “an accumulation of several operational challenges” for over 300 of its flights getting cancelled and many delayed over the past two days. In an internal email to employees, seen by HT, Indigo CEO Pieter Elbers listed “minor technology glitches, schedule changes, adverse weather conditions, heightened congestion in the aviation ecosystem, and the implementation of the newly released FDTL norms”. Implementation of new Flight Duty Time Limit (FDTL) norms for pilots from November 1 hit many flights, resulting in dozens of cancellations, despite airlines having enough time to plan for a change originally expected to kick in on June 1, 2024. “These past few days have been difficult for many of our IndiGo customers and colleagues. We serve close to 380,000 customers a day and want each of them to have a good experience. We could not live up to that promise these past days and we have publicly apologized for that,” Pieter Elbers wrote in the email. Over 300 IndiGo flights were cancelled on Thursday as chaos continued at major airports across India, with the country's dominant carrier struggling to adapt to stringent new crew rostering rules. On Wednesday, IndiGo cancelled at least 150 flights and announced that it had initiated “calibrated adjustments” to its schedules for the next 48 hours. In his email, IndiGo CEO Elbers wrote: “We have faced tough moments before, but we turned challenges into triumphs, proving our resilience, strength, and unity. This moment will be no different."" “Given the size, scale and complexity of our network, these disruptions grow large immediately and require interventions on multiple levels and dimensions. For that a lot of work is being conducted right now,” he further explained. Elbers expressed “gratitude and appreciation to all the colleagues in operations, including Pilots, Cabin Crew, OCC, Engineers, Customer Support, Digital, frontline staff at airport and their leadership teams who are working tirelessly to manage the situation, minimize the impact, and restore stability as quickly as possible”. He said IndiGo is feeling its customers' concern and anxieties “just as deeply”. “We are proactively reaching out to affected customers and helping them in every way possible to ease their discomfort,” he added. “Our immediate goal is to normalize our operations and bring punctuality back on track in the coming days, which is not an easy target. But this is the time for all of us to come together, prove our mettle once again and showcase what IndiGo truly stands for,” he told the staff. He mentioned the recent software update in some Airbus planes as an example of speed and success. “Just a few days ago, we performed remarkably well as a united team to achieve an unimaginable feat of upgrading 200 aircraft (A320s) in less than 24 hours.

Officials said that as per his daily routine, Amitabh Jain, who lived with his wife Ritu Jain in the upscale locality of DLF Phase-II, was cycling in the internal lanes of his colony when a white Hyundai Santro, bearing a Delhi registration number, hit him from behind at 7.14 am, Wednesday. The car driver accelerated and fled from the spot, a senior police officer said. “Locals alerted his wife as they knew Jain well. He was rushed to a private hospital in Sector 56 in an ambulance immediately. Doctors tried to resuscitate him but failed,” he said. Neighbours said Jain’s son lives in London while a daughter is in Bengaluru. The car owner has been traced, said Sandeep Turan, public relations officer of Gurugram Police. “A police team had raided his residence but he could not be found. He is evading arrest but we will catch him soon,” he said. Turan said the hit-and-run incident was captured in multiple CCTV cameras at the spot, from which it was evident that Jain was cycling on a side when the car was coming from behind. “The car suddenly veered off course and ended up hitting Jain from behind. A police team found his mangled cycle at the spot,” he said. The car registration number was clearly visible in the CCTV camera footage, he added. “There is a probability that the man driving the car was returning drunk from a party or pub. However, things will become clearer only after the driver is arrested,” he further said.

She said that within hours of arriving from Ahmedabad, she felt her “eyes burning,” her throat giving out, and her sinuses shutting down, despite wearing a mask for most of her trip. (Also Read: Delhi woman cleans clogged air purifier as city battles severe AQI: ‘Even it deserves a spa day’) Sethi said she moved back to India from Denmark two years ago to scale her design studio because she “loves this country. The food, the people, the ambition”. But the air pollution, she wrote, “is not normal and should not be treated like it is”. Sethi said that while many people see pollution as numbers on an Air Quality Index (AQI) chart, for her, it is personal. “Most people see this issue from a distance… For me, those ‘people’ are my parents. My family. And watching them accept this as normal feels painful,” she wrote. She also described looking out of the airplane window and seeing skies that seemed “not hazy, but unlivable”. Sethi concluded her post calling for urgent action. “This should be a national priority. Not an occasional headline. Moving out is not a real solution for most. Leaving the country is not my solution either,” she said. “If you are building something to solve this in India, reach out. If you are working on air quality, climate, monitoring, filtration, mobility, enforcement or anything in this direction, reach out. I’m happy to volunteer and help however I can. Even if it’s small. This is one problem we can’t afford to normalise,” she added.

Starc refuses to accept Wasim Akram's record: ‘He’s a far better bowler than me',"Subscribe Now! Get features like Mitchell Starc may now stand alone as the most successful left-arm fast bowler in Test history, but the Australian quick insists he does not belong in the same conversation as the legendary Wasim Akram. Starc overtook the iconic Pakistani pacer during a commanding spell on day one of the second Ashes Test at the Gabba, where his six-wicket haul lifted him to 418 career Test wickets, four clear of Akram’s long-standing tally of 414. Yet despite the milestone, the 35-year-old immediately deflected comparisons with the man widely regarded as the greatest left-arm bowler ever to grace the game. “Wasim’s still a far better bowler than I am,” Starc told former England captain Michael Vaughan after stumps on Thursday. “As far as I’m concerned, he’s still the pinnacle of left-armers and certainly he’s right up there with the best bowlers to ever play the game. It’s nice to be spoken of up around that, but I’ll just try to keep churning a few out.” Akram, for his part, lauded Starc for breaking his record. With Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood sidelined through injury and Nathan Lyon omitted, Starc spearheaded a depleted Australian attack in the day-night contest. He admitted the absence of his usual partners made the occasion feel unusual. “I don’t think I’ve ever played in an attack without one of the three of them playing,” he said. “So it’s a little bit different in that regard.” Still, Starc delivered the one spell England struggled to withstand, claiming three wickets in his opening burst before breaking the record with the dismissal of Harry Brook, caught at slip. His dominance continued throughout the day as he remained the only bowler consistently troubling the visitors. “I get asked all the time, I still don't know. It is what it is. I think it's still like a white ball. Today, it was a soft ball,” Starc said when asked to explain his success with the pink ball. Starc’s surge caps a remarkable run of form in the series. After ripping England apart with a career-best 7–58 in the first innings in Perth, he has now taken 16 wickets in the Ashes so far, rising to 15th on the all-time Test wicket-taker list. He has already moved past Harbhajan Singh (417) and now has Shaun Pollock (421) and Richard Hadlee (431) within sight. He is also closing in on the most prolific left-arm bowler in Test history across all types — Sri Lankan great Rangana Herath, whose 433 wickets remain the benchmark Starc may challenge next.",real,https://www.hindustantimes.com,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/mitchell-starc-refuses-to-accept-wasim-akrams-record-after-ashes-magic-he-s-a-far-better-bowler-than-i-am-101764856695588.html
"Shami sends another reminder to Agarkar, Hardik Pandya shows might with the ball","Subscribe Now! Get features like Senior India pacer Mohammed Shami issued another loud and timely reminder to chief selector Ajit Agarkar, dismantling Services with a superb four-wicket haul to steer Bengal to a convincing seven-wicket victory in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy on Thursday. Shami, who has been on the fringes of the India set-up in all formats despite being fully fit and available for selection, showcased all his experience and control during a spell that completely shifted the match. The 34-year-old returned outstanding figures of 4 for 13, striking twice in his opening over to remove both openers before returning later to clean up the tail. His efforts ensured Services were restricted to 165 in 18.2 overs, a total that always looked short on a true surface. While pacer Akash Deep backed him up with an energetic 3 for 27, it was Shami’s precision and relentlessness that set the tone for Bengal’s dominance. Mukesh Kumar endured a rare off day, but the combined effort of the attack kept the pressure firmly on Services throughout the innings. Bengal’s reply was ruthless. Captain Abhimanyu Easwaran, eager to strengthen his case ahead of next month’s IPL auction, smashed 58 off 37 balls, while wicketkeeper-batter Abhishek Porel unleashed an explosive 56 off 29. Their 93-run partnership in just over eight overs effectively sealed the contest, as Bengal raced to 167 for 3 in 15.1 overs. For Shami, the performance adds to a growing body of domestic evidence highlighting his continued relevance in India’s fast-bowling ecosystem. With every outing, the veteran seamer appears intent on reminding the selectors that he remains one of the country’s most potent white-ball operators. In a much-watched Group stage clash of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Hardik Pandya delivered a disciplined bowling performance, helping Baroda ease to an eight-wicket win over Gujarat in a low-scoring encounter. Coming off a blazing innings against Punjab in his comeback match, Hardik showed his value with the ball this time, returning figures of 1 for 16 from four overs, applying relentless pressure on a struggling Gujarat lineup. Gujarat’s innings never took off as they crumbled for a mere 73 in 14.1 overs, with only two batters managing to enter double figures. Hardik removed the dangerous Urvil Patel (7), who chipped a return catch back to the all-rounder. Young seamer Raj Limbani was the star with the ball, producing a superb spell of 3 for 5, ripping through the middle order. Baroda’s chase was swift and clinical. They wrapped up the target in just 6.4 overs, though Hardik himself managed only 10 off 6 deliveries. With the job done, the all-rounder is set to travel to Cuttack on December 6 to join the Indian T20I squad for the five-match series beginning December 9. Kamboj, Thakral and Dalal Lead Haryana to Commanding Win In another Group fixture, Haryana produced a complete performance to seal a seven-wicket victory over Himachal Pradesh. Seamers Anshul Kamboj (3 for 44) and Anuj Thakral (3 for 31) shared six wickets between them, restricting HP to 176 for 8 despite a fighting 44 from Ekant Sen. Haryana’s batting response was anchored by the in-form Yashvardhan Dalal, who smashed an unbeaten 76 off 44 balls, featuring seven boundaries and four towering sixes. His authoritative innings ensured Haryana crossed the finish line with two overs to spare, finishing on 177 for 3 in 18 overs.",real,https://www.hindustantimes.com,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/mohammed-shami-sends-another-reminder-to-ajit-agarkar-hardik-pandya-shows-might-with-the-ball-101764858643753.html
Irfan Pathan slams Ravindra Jadeja after India's loss to South Africa,"Subscribe Now! Get features like Former player Irfan Pathan was left fuming by Ravindra Jadeja's batting performance in the second ODI against South Africa in Raipur. Defending a target of 359 runs, India failed to defend, as South Africa reached 362/6 in 49.2 overs, winning by four wickets. The hosts got only 74 runs in the last 10 overs, and Jadeja's strike rate of 88.89 was the second lowest in the Indian innings (among batters who faced 20 balls minimum). Speaking on his YouTube show, the former Indian cricketer said, ""There was one issue for me. Ravindra Jadeja’s innings, which was 27 balls for 24 not out, felt extremely slow. During commentary we were saying that this could hurt India, and in the end that became the difference. If you are in such a strong position, above 300, and everyone is striking above a run a ball while you are at 88, it clearly means the innings lacked urgency. Sometimes a slower innings happens, and that is fine, but the intent from Jadeja was disappointing."" ""The intent could have been better. And I am not saying this in hindsight. We said it during commentary as well. It looked like the ball would get wet, which always causes problems for the fielding side. South Africa’s plan was to start carefully. But Jadeja not pulling his weight with the bat became a disappointing factor for India,” he added. Jadeja failed to hit a single six, remaining unbeaten at 24* off 27 balls. The result was disappointing for India as Virat Kohli and Ruturaj Gaikwad got tons. Meanwhile, KL Rahul (66*) got a half-century. Kohli smacked 102 runs off 93 balls, also hitting seven fours and two sixes. Meanwhile, Gaikwad slammed 105 off 83 deliveries, packed with 12 fours and two maximums.",real,https://www.hindustantimes.com,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/irfan-pathan-slams-ravindra-jadeja-after-indias-loss-to-south-africa-lack-of-urgency-with-the-bat-disappointing-101764850398732.html
Joe Root forces Australia to 'admit he’s a great' with maiden century Down Under,"Subscribe Now! Get features like Joe Root finally erased one of the few remaining gaps in his glittering career record on Thursday, scoring his first Test century in Australia during the day-night Ashes Test at the Gabba. The long-awaited hundred ended a 15-Test drought in Australia stretching back to his debut Ashes tour in 2013. Arriving at the crease in the third over with England in deep trouble at 5-2 after Mitchell Starc’s searing opening burst, Root steadied the innings with trademark calm. The No. 1-ranked Test batter compiled his century with grit and precision, reaching the milestone off 181 balls under the lights and in front of a packed crowd of 37,117. Root was 88 not out at the drinks break midway through the night session before moving into the 90s with consecutive boundaries off Brendan Doggett. At 98, he survived the dismissal of partner Will Jacks, who fell to Starc after a 40-run stand, and seized his moment in the next over, turning Scott Boland to the leg side for the run that sealed his breakthrough hundred. He kissed the badge on his helmet and lifted his bat as England Cricket’s travelling supporters roared in celebration. It was Root’s 40th Test century in his 160th match, further solidifying his status as one of the format’s modern greats. With more than 13,600 runs, he sits second on the all-time Test run-scorers list behind Sachin Tendulkar. His innings featured a series of crucial partnerships that revived England from a perilous start: 117 with Zac Crawley (76), 54 with Harry Brook (31), 44 with captain Ben Stokes, and an unbroken 61-run stand with No. 11 Jofra Archer to push England to 325-9 at stumps. Reaction flowed swiftly from past greats. Former England captain Alastair Cook, speaking on TNT Sports, said: ""Even Australians have to admit he is a great now."" Former Australia opener Matthew Hayden, in a video shared by England Cricket, offered a characteristically wholehearted endorsement: ""Congratulations, mate, on your first century in Australia. It took you a while, but there was no one who had more skin in the game than me, literally, I was backing you for a hundred. So congratulations, mate. Ten fifties and finally a hundred. You little ripper, mate."" The England and Wales Cricket Board celebrated the moment on X, writing: “No doubt before. No doubt now. A true great of the game.” Australia fast bowler Mitchell Starc, who picked up six wickets on Thursday, also paid tribute to Root. ""I think he's scored a lot of 50s in Australia and I'm sure he'd be relieved to get that 100,"" Starc said. ""He played fantastically well today and assessed the conditions, sucked up some pressure and got the result by the end of the day.""",real,https://www.hindustantimes.com,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/joe-root-forces-australia-to-admit-hes-a-great-after-ending-12-year-drought-with-maiden-ashes-century-down-under-101764851087461.html

In the commentary box, at the presentation ceremony and during his time as head coach of the Indian team between 2017 and 2021. Besides his presence in the team, which saw his baritone voice put players in their places, Shastri was always a welcome sight whenever India won a game. Some of his gems will stand the test of time, rest assured, and the fact that with time, he even acknowledged some of the drunk memes targetted at him, to the extent that he borderline even enjoyed them, tells you why Shastri remains one of the most colourful characters in world cricket, let alone India. Then again, when it’s serious business, one glimpse of Shastri can make you shake in your boots. With endless talks around Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Shastri, who has not shied away from sharing his two cents about their future, for a chance, fired a serious warning at the BCCI. Without naming anyone, Shastri’s message was clear: don’t mess with Ro-Ko. Reminding the world whose Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma really are, Shastri hinted that cornering them for a personal agenda is like shooting yourself in the foot.

Watch the teaser clip: A very important part of that teaser summed up the tension between Ro-Ko and those trying to sideline them. When the interview asked, ‘Who are these people having ‘masti’ with them?' Shastri simply said, “The ones who want to”. While previously, Shastri had always taken the safer side, insisting that Kohli and Rohit would only play in the 2027 World Cup if their bodies and form held up, this time around, the 62-year-old sounded entirely different. Shastri had even said that it won’t be easy for Kohli and Rohit to last until the African safari two years from now, with more youngsters knocking loudly on the door of the selectors’ door. However, this fresh take promises to come as music to every Ro-Ko fan’s ear. ""You can’t buy experience from the market outside. One is a master chaser, the other one has three double centuries in ODI cricket,” he added, indirectly calling Kohli and Rohit irreplaceable. Who else but the BCCI has the power over Kohli and Rohit?Kohli and Rohit continue to make headlines in Indian cricket, as does the BCCI, and more importantly, the other two individuals – head coach Gautam Gambhir and chairman of selectors, Ajit Agarkar – who reportedly aren’t getting along too well with Ro-Ko.

Visuals of their cold exchange after the 1st ODI in Ranchi surfaced online, only adding weight to this theory. Besides, Kohli’s decision to play the Vijay Hazare Trophy strengthens the BCCI’s stance that both he and Rohit must feature in domestic cricket if they wish to continue in ODIs and stay in contention for the 2027 World Cup in South Africa.

Get features like Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc received a glowing tribute from Pakistan legend Wasim Akram after overtaking him to become the highest wicket-taker among all left-arm fast bowlers in Test cricket. Starc crossed Akram’s tally during the second session on Day 1 of the pink-ball Test against England at the Gabba on Thursday, when he dismissed Harry Brook to claim the historic wicket. Earlier, he had removed Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope in a fiery opening burst, marking yet another dominant display under lights. With his latest haul, Starc now stands at 418 Test wickets in 102 matches, averaging 26.43. His performance at the Gabba also saw him complete his 18th five-wicket haul, removing Duckett, Pope, Brook, Will Jacks, Gus Atkinson, and lastly Brydon Carse to secure his second fifer of the ongoing Ashes series. At Stumps on Day 1 of the day-night Test, England were at 325 for nine largely due to Joe Root's maiden Test century in Australia. Starc finished the day with figures of 6 for 71 in 19 overs. Akram, who held the record for nearly two decades with 414 wickets in 104 Tests at 23.62, was quick to praise Starc’s achievement. In a message shared on X, the Pakistani great wrote: ""Super Starc!

The 88-year-old Army veteran, who still works full-time at a grocery store, will soon be handed a cheque worth nearly $1.5 million, money raised online to help him finally retire and live comfortably. The money was raised through a GoFundMe launched by an Australian influencer who happened to meet Bambas during his travels. He interviewed the 88-year-old and uploaded the interaction on social media, leading to it going viral. Support flowed in from all quarters as people wanted to help out the senior citizen with his finances. According to the New York Post, Ed Bambas is an 88-year-old employee at the Meijer grocery store in Brighton, Michigan. He is an Army veteran who worked at General Motors and retired from there in 1999. However, the company went bankrupt in 2012, and that led to Bambas’ pension getting wiped out. Things became even more critical for the Army vet when his wife, to whom he had been married for more than 50 years, fell seriously ill. With no pension and no healthcare coverage, Bambas had to sell his house and property to fund his wife’s treatment and make ends meet. After his wife died seven years ago, the Post informs, he had to go back to work – that too, a 40-hour workweek at a supermarket 45 miles west of Detroit.

"Artist turns Musk, Zuckerberg, more billionaires into robot dogs dumping NFTs","Subscribe Now! Get features like Mike Winkelmann, famously known as Beeple, has turned billionaires into robot dogs ""pooping out NFTs. Tech titans like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos were featured at the famed artist's latest show titled Regular Animals at the Art Basel Miami Beach, according to a Page Six report. In the now-viral videos from the event, four-legged robots with hyperrealistic masks can be seen roaming around, taking photos, and eerily squatting down to print out the snaps. Renowned artists Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol were also featured as canine robots along with the exhibit's creator Beeple, himself. While onlookers dubbed the spectacle “creepy” and “freaky,” Winkelmann said that his art had a deeper message. “It used to be that we saw the world interpreted through the eyes of artists, but now Mark Zuckerberg and Elon, in particular, control a huge amount of how we see the world,” he told the outlet.

And so we wanted to kind of play with that idea,” the 44-year-old went on, adding that while Bezos' canine robot did not make prints, he had to be a part of the exhibit because the Amazon founder is “another person who shapes how we see the world.” Winkelmann further said that people are now “increasingly seeing the world through the eyes of AI and robotics,” adding, “I think that will happen more and more.” The hyper-realistic masks were designed by famed mask-maker Landon Meier, according to the outlet.

"India-Russia collaboration not against anyone, aims to safeguard interests:Putin","Subscribe Now! Get features like New Delhi: India-Russia collaboration isn’t directed against anyone, and the agenda of the two countries is focused on safeguarding their interests without harming others, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said against the backdrop of the US administration pressuring New Delhi to reduce purchases of Russian oil and defence equipment. Russia is keen to ramp up cooperation with India in civil nuclear energy, defence and trade, Putin said in an interview with the India Today ahead of his arrival in New Delhi late on Thursday for a summit meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. He noted that the world will be watching his visit because of the rapid strides made by India in areas ranging from economic development to healthcare. Putin responded to a question on US President Donald Trump’s possible reaction to India-Russia collaboration by saying: “Neither I nor Prime Minister Modi, despite certain external pressure we face, have ever… approached our collaboration as working against someone. “President Trump has his own agenda, his own goals, whereas we focus on ours – not against anyone, but rather aimed at safeguarding… India’s and Russia’s interests. In our dealings, we cause no harm to others, and I believe leaders from other countries should appreciate this.” Referring to India’s purchases of Russian energy, Putin said the US itself buys nuclear fuel from Russia for its reactors. “If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn’t India have the same privilege? This question deserves thorough examination, and we stand ready to discuss it, including with President Trump,” he said. The US pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil “involves employing political instruments to influence normal competition”, Putin said. However, Russia’s energy cooperation with India remains unaffected by “fleeting political swings or the tragic events in Ukraine”. More than 90% of India-Russia transactions are conducted in national currencies and there are solutions whenever complications arise, Putin said. “We can switch to the existing systems for exchanging electronic messages on financial transactions of the Bank of Russia and of our partners in India. These efforts are ongoing and advancing.” Trump has hit India with a 25% punitive levy over Russian oil purchases, and Washington has pushed New Delhi to cut back on buying Russian energy and military gear as part of the US administration’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Several key members of the Trump administration have also criticised India’s close strategic partnership with Russia. Putin acknowledged a “certain decline in overall trade turnover during the first nine months” of 2025 but said trade in petroleum products and crude oil, and the production of petroleum products for consumers of Russian oil, is “running smoothly in India”. He said that even before the Ukraine crisis, Indian and Russian business entities in the hydrocarbons sector had built a solid commercial relationship based on mutual trust. “It’s widely known that one of our leading companies acquired an oil refinery in India – this investment represented one of the largest foreign inflows into the Indian economy, totalling more than $20 billion,” he said, referring to Rosneft’s stake in a refinery in Gujarat. “Our company has been continuously expanding operations of this refinery, working with its partners… As a result, India has become one of the major refined product suppliers to Europe – not just because it buys our oil with a discount,” he said. “Certain actors clearly dislike India’s growing role in international markets owing to its ties with Russia. Consequently, they’re seeking means to constrain India’s influence for political reasons by imposing artificial obstacles.” Asked how India and Russia should handle Trump and the US administration, Putin said the US President has advisors who believe that implementing tariff policies involving additional duties on trade partners ultimately benefits the US economy. “Our experts believe there are risks involved, but it is the choice of each country and its leadership to decide which economic policy to adopt. We have never engaged in such practices,” he said. “We hope that, in the end, all violations of World Trade Organisation regulations will be rectified.” Putin noted that the world order is changing, with new centres of power emerging, making it “crucial to ensure stability among major nations” to facilitate progress in bilateral and international relations. Collaborative endeavours between Russia and India “carry significant weight because they transcend our mutual ties”, he said. Ensuring stability in key areas of engagement is crucial as it helps the fulfilment of objectives, and Russia and India have many practical areas of cooperation, he said. “The world would be watching my visit – there’s no big deal here. India is an enormous country, home to one-and-a-half billion people, boasting a growing economy with a 7% annual growth rate, leading among major global powers,” he added. “We’ve laid out an ambitious plan for our collaboration in key domains. The most critical areas are indeed forward-looking. I’m referring specifically to high technology,” Putin said, citing space, nuclear power, shipbuilding, aviation, and artificial intelligence. India cannot be treated the way it was treated 77 years ago, as it is a major global player, and Modi is “not someone who succumbs to pressure easily”, he said. “[Modi’s] stance is unwavering and straightforward, without being confrontational. Our goal is not to provoke conflict; rather, we aim to protect our lawful rights. India does the same,” he said. In the field of defence, Putin said India stands out as one of Russia’s reliable and privileged partners. “We see how India values this relationship too. Why? Allow me to emphasise again – we are not simply selling technology, we are sharing it, and it is a very rare thing to see in the sphere of military-technical cooperation. It speaks to the level of trust between the two countries.” The two sides have a broad portfolio, including naval construction, rocket and missile engineering, and aircraft engineering. India operates several Russian-made aircraft and produces the T-90 tanks, while the BrahMos cruise missile – a joint venture between Russia and India – is “manufactured primarily at Indian facilities”. The two sides are now discussing cutting-edge technologies, and the value of certain weapons has multiplied following combat experience, he said. In the civil nuclear sector, Putin described Russia as a producer of the most advanced and reliable equipment for nuclear plants. State-run Rosatom builds and operates 22 nuclear units around the world, more than any other company, including the Kudankulam plant in India. “These are large units, they operate efficiently and, I reiterate, have proven to be very useful.” Russia is also the only country capable of building small nuclear power plants. “Such plants are already operational in Russia, and we can make them either floating or ground-based. It’s an excellent option for specific regions where big power stations are not needed,” he said. ---",real,https://www.hindustantimes.com,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiarussia-collaboration-not-against-anyone-aims-to-safeguard-interests-putin-101764870774386.html
Punjab has maximum cases of human trafficking: Jaishankar in Parliament,"Subscribe Now! Get features like New Delhi: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday told the Rajya Sabha that Punjab has the maximum number of human trafficking cases in the country. ""As far as states are concerned, the maximum number of trafficking cases is from the state of Punjab,"" the minister said while replying to supplementaries during the question hour.

"भारत पहुंचे पुतिन से गले मिले PM मोदी: एयरपोर्ट पर रिसीव किया, एक ही गाड़ी में रवाना हुए; पीएम आवास में प्राइवेट डिनर शुरू1:40","रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन भारत पहुंच गए हैं। प्रधानमंत्री मोदी ने एयरपोर्ट पर उन्हें रिसीव किया। दोनों नेताओं ने एक दूसरे को गले लगाया। मोदी और पुतिन एक ही गाड़ी में बैठकर एयरपोर्ट से प्रधानमंत्री आवास पहुंचे। यहां पीएम मोदी ने पुतिन के सम्मान में प्राइवेट डिनर रखा है। रूस-यूक्रेन जंग शुरू होने के बाद पुतिन का यह पहला भारत दौरा है। PM मोदी ने रूसी राष्ट्रपति से मुलाकात की तस्वीरें सोशल मीडिया पर शेयर कीं। उन्होंने कहा कि वे दोस्त पुतिन का स्वागत करते बहुत खुश हैं। भारत और रूस की दोस्ती मुश्किल समय में कसौटी पर खरी उतरी है। पुतिन के भारत दौरे से जुड़ीं 7 तस्वीरें... रूसी राष्ट्रपति पुतिन भारत दौरे को लेकर गूगल पर ट्रेंड कर रहे हैं... सोर्स- गूगल ट्रेंड्स पुतिन के भारत दौरे से जुड़े अपडेट्स के लिए नीचे लाइव ब्लॉग से गुजर जाइए... ​​​​​​राष्ट्रपति पुतिन अभी प्रधानमंत्री आवास में हैं। यहां वे PM मोदी के साथ प्राइवेट डिनर कर रहे हैं। प्रधानमंत्री मोदी ने राष्ट्रपति पुतिन का अपने आधिकारिक आवास पर स्वागत के फोटो शेयर किए हैं। साथ में लिखा- मैंने अपने दोस्त, राष्ट्रपति पुतिन का 7 लोक कल्याण मार्ग पर स्वागत किया। रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन के भारत दौरे पर कांग्रेस नेता शशि थरूर ने कहा- यह बहुत महत्वपूर्ण दौरा है। मुझे लगता है कि उनकी यात्रा हमारे देश के लिए बड़ी अहमियत रखती है। रूस के साथ हमारा रिश्ता काफी अच्छा है। यह रिश्ता किसी और देश के साथ हमारे रिश्तों को खराब नहीं करती। हमारे अमेरिका, चीन, यूरोप और बाकी देशों से भी अच्छे संबंध हैं, और आगे भी रहेंगे। पुतिन को लेकर आ रही फ्लाइट आज दुनिया में सबसे ज्यादा ट्रैक की गई फ्लाइट रही। फ्लाइट ट्रैकिंग वेबसाइट Flightradar24 के मुताबिक बड़ी संख्या में लोगों ने इस विमान की लाइव लोकेशन देखी। Flightradar24 ने एक्स पर पोस्ट करते हुए बताया,“हमारी साइट पर अभी सबसे ज्यादा ट्रैक की जा रही फ्लाइट रूसी सरकार का वह विमान है, जो भारत की ओर आ रहा है। रूसी राष्ट्रपति पुतिन और भारतीय प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी अगले दो दिनों तक दिल्ली में मुलाकात करेंगे।” मोदी ने X पर कहा, 'अपने दोस्त, राष्ट्रपति पुतिन का भारत में स्वागत करते हुए मुझे बहुत खुशी हो रही है। आज शाम और कल हमारी बातचीत का बेसब्री से इंतजार है। भारत-रूस की दोस्ती मुश्किल समय की कसौटी पर खरी उतरी है और इससे हमारे लोगों को बहुत फायदा हुआ है।' पुतिन के स्वागत में उत्तर प्रदेश के वाराणसी में गंगा आरती के दौरान दीयों से 'वेलकम पुतिन' लिखा गया। प्रधानमंत्री मोदी और रूसी राष्ट्रपति पुतिन पालम एयरपोर्ट से रवाना होने के कुछ ही मिनट बाद दिल्ली में 7, लोक कल्याण मार्ग स्थित प्रधानमंत्री के आधिकारिक आवास पर पहुंचे हैं। मोदी और पुतिन एक ही टोयोटा SUV में साथ सफर करते नजर आए। इससे पहले चीन के तिआनजिन शहर में पुतिन ने मोदी को अपनी लिमोजिन कार में साथ बैठाया था। दिल्ली में मोदी ने उसी अंदाज में पुतिन का स्वागत किया। पुतिन के विमान का नाम इल्यूशिन-96 (IL96) है। इस प्लेन पर रूसी भाषा में россия लिखा होता है, जिसका मतलब रूस है। यह सिरिलिक (Cyrillic) लिपि में लिखा जाता है। रूसी राष्ट्रपति भारत पहुंच गए हैं। उनका विमान पालम एयरपोर्ट लैंड कर गया है। PM मोदी एयरपोर्ट पर उन्हें खुद रिसीव करने के लिए पहुंचे हैं। पुतिन के भारत पहुंचने से पहले रूस के कई मंत्री दिल्ली पहुंच चुके हैं। इनमें डिप्टी प्रधानमंत्री डेनिस मांतुरोव, रक्षा मंत्री सर्गेई शोइगु और कृषि मंत्री दिमित्री पेट्रोव शामिल हैं। रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमिर पुतिन को रिसीव करने के लिए पीएम मोदी पालम एयरपोर्ट पहुंच चुके हैं। पुतिन के भारत आगमन से पहले दिल्ली में गार्ड ऑफ ऑनर की तैयारी तेज हो गई है। एयरपोर्ट पर तीनों सेनाओं थलसेना, नौसेना और वायुसेना के संयुक्त दस्ते ने रिहर्सल शुरू कर दी है। सेना के बैंड, मार्चिंग टुकड़ी और सलामी गार्ड का अभ्यास निर्धारित प्रोटोकॉल के अनुसार चल रहा है। रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन को रिसीव करने के लिए पीएम मोदी दिल्ली एयरपोर्ट पहुंच चुके हैं। सोशल मीडिया पर मोदी-पुतिन की 25 साल पुरानी तस्वीर वायरल हो रही है। इस रिश्ते की शुरुआत 2001 से मानी जाती है, जब नरेंद्र मोदी गुजरात के नए-नए मुख्यमंत्री बने थे और वे तत्कालीन प्रधानमंत्री अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी के साथ उनकी मॉस्को यात्रा पर गए थे। पुतिन का प्लेन भारतीय एयर स्पेस में आ चुका है। कुछ ही देर में पुतिन दिल्ली पहुंचेंगे। पीएम मोदी, रूसी राष्ट्रपति पुतिन को रिसीव करने के लिए एयरपोर्ट जा सकते हैं। इससे पहले आखिरी बार फरवरी 2025 में पीएम मोदी कतर के अमीर शेख तमीम बिन हमद अल थानी को रिसीव करने एयरपोर्ट पहुंचे थे। रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन गुरुवार शाम दो दिन की राजकीय यात्रा पर नई दिल्ली पहुंचेंगे। लैंड करने के बाद वे सीधे पीएम मोदी के घर डिनर के लिए जाएंगे। दोनों नेताओं की बातचीत रात करीब 8.30 बजे तक चलने की उम्मीद है। बैठक खत्म होने के बाद पुतिन रात के लिए अपने होटल लौट जाएंगे। बीबीसी के मुताबिक रूस में भारतीय सामान की मौजूदगी बहुत कम है, जैसे- मोदी चाहते हैं कि युद्ध खत्म होने के बाद रूस की अर्थव्यवस्था खुलते ही भारतीय सामान वहां बड़ी मात्रा में जाए। रूस से भारत की 2 अरब डॉलर की नई परमाणु सबमरीन खरीदने की डील का दावा गलत निकला है। सरकार ने इसे खारिज कर दिया है। हाल ही में मीडिया रिपोर्ट्स में कहा गया था कि भारत ने पुतिन की यात्रा से पहले रूस के साथ नई सबमरीन डील फाइनल कर ली है। हालांकि, सरकारी फैक्ट एजेंसी PIB Fact Check ने इन रिपोर्टों को भ्रामक बताया। एजेंसी के मुताबिक भारत और रूस के बीच कोई नई डील साइन नहीं हुई है। जिस सबमरीन प्रोग्राम की बात हो रही है, उसका कॉन्ट्रैक्ट मार्च 2019 में ही हुआ था। डिलीवरी में देरी के चलते अब नई डिलीवरी टाइमलाइन 2028 तय की गई है। रूस के रक्षा मंत्री आंद्रेई को मानेकशॉ सेंटर पर गार्ड ऑफ ऑनर दिया गया। इसके बाद रक्षा मंत्री राजनाथ सिंह और रूस के उनके समकक्ष आंद्रेई ने नेशनल वॉर मेमोरियल पर पुष्पचक्र अर्पित किए। रूस अपना Su-57 स्टेल्थ फाइटर जेट और उसकी तकनीक बिना शर्त के भारत को देने के लिए तैयार है। रूसी Su-57 जेट्स को अमेरिका के F-35 का तोड़ माना जाता है। Su-57 की तरह F-35 भी 5वीं जेनरेशन का लड़ाकू विमान है। इसे इस तरह से डिजाइन किया गया है कि यह दुश्मन के रडार को चकमा दे सके। रूस का कहना है कि Su-57 की तकनीक पर कोई रोक नहीं होगी। इसमें इंजन, रडार, स्टेल्थ तकनीक और आधुनिक हथियारों की जानकारी भी दी जा सकती है। रूस ने यह भी कहा कि अगर भारत चाहे तो Su-57 को भारत में ही बनाया जा सकता है।रूस ने भारत को टू-सीटर Su-57 बनाने की जॉइंट प्लानिंग का भी प्रस्ताव दिया है बीबीसी के मुताबिक पुतिन की यह यात्रा ऐसे समय हो रही है जब मोदी अपनी वैश्विक भूमिका को मजबूत करना चाहते हैं। भारत-रूस संबंध सोवियत काल से चले आ रहे हैं। पुतिन ने इस रिश्ते पर सबसे अधिक ध्यान दिया है। दूसरी ओर, मोदी ने पश्चिमी दबाव के बावजूद रूस की आलोचना नहीं की और कहा कि बातचीत ही युद्ध का हल है। इसे भारत की रणनीतिक स्वायत्तता कहा जाता है। यानी भारत न रूस को छोड़े, न पश्चिम को नाराज करे और दोनों के साथ संतुलन बनाए रखे। यह संतुलन तब तक ठीक चलता रहा, जब तक ट्रम्प दोबारा व्हाइट हाउस नहीं आए। ट्रम्प के लौटने के बाद भारत-अमेरिका संबंध सबसे खराब दौर में चले गए। टैरिफ का मामला अभी भी अटका हुआ है। ऐसे में, पुतिन का दौरा मोदी के लिए और भी अहम हो जाता है, क्योंकि यह उनकी रणनीतिक स्वतंत्रता की असली परीक्षा है। भारत को दिखाना है कि वह पुतिन का भरोसेमंद साझेदार है और साथ ही ट्रम्प या यूरोप को भी पूरी तरह नाराज नहीं कर रहा। मोदी को यह संतुलन साधना होगा कि रूस से रिश्ते मजबूत रहें, लेकिन अमेरिका और यूरोप के साथ चल रही व्यापार वार्ताएं भी न बिगड़ें। एक तरफ भारत, रूस से अपने संबंध पुराने तरीके से बनाए रखना चाहता है, वहीं दूसरी तरफ वह अमेरिका और यूरोपीय देशों के साथ भी रक्षा सहयोग बढ़ा रहा है। पिछले दस साल में भारत ने अमेरिका और फ्रांस जैसे देशों से हथियारों की खरीद बढ़ाई है। इसकी वजह से रूस की हिस्सेदारी कम हुई है, हालांकि रूस अभी भी भारत का सबसे बड़ा हथियार सप्लायर है। कई बड़े डिफेंस सिस्टम जैसे न्यूक्लियर सबमरीन, मिसाइल डिफेंस और कुछ खास तकनीक जिन्हें दुनिया में कुछ ही देश बेचते हैं, रूस उनमें आगे है। SIPRI की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक जहां 2000 के दशक में रूस, भारत को 70% से 90% तक हथियार सप्लाई करता था, वहीं अब यह घटकर लगभग 36% रह गया है। पुतिन दो दिन के भारत दौरे पर 23वीं भारत-रूस समिट में भाग लेंगे। ये भारत और रूस के बीच होने वाली सालाना बैठक का हिस्सा है। हर साल दोनों देश बारी-बारी से इस बैठक की मेजबानी करते हैं। इस बार भारत की बारी है। इस समिट का मकसद है कि दोनों देश 2030 तक अपने व्यापार को 100 अरब डॉलर तक ले जाएं। इस फोरम में एनर्जी, इन्वेस्टमेंट, तकनीक और इंडस्ट्री जैसे कई सेक्टर में नई साझेदारियों पर बात होगी। भारत और रूस स्पेस, न्यूक्लियर एनर्जी, साइंस-टेक्नीक, व्यापार और पोर्ट्स के विकास पर भी बातचीत करने वाले हैं। भारत रूस की मदद से कुडनकुलम (तमिलनाडु) में न्यूक्लियर पावर प्लांट चला रहा है। इस प्रोजेक्ट को आगे बढ़ाने को लेकर भी बात हो सकती है। दोनों देश एक स्किल डेवलपमेंट समझौते पर भी बात कर सकते हैं। रूस में युद्ध के बाद कई क्षेत्रों में वर्कर्स की कमी हो गई है। रूस चाहता है कि भारत से तकनीकी एक्सपर्ट, मेडिकल स्टाफ, इंजीनियर और दूसरे ट्रेंड वर्कर्स वहां काम करने आएं। भारत के लिए भी यह बड़ा अवसर हो सकता है, क्योंकि इससे भारतीयों को विदेश में नौकरी के नए मौके मिलेंगे। भारत से 10 लाख स्किल्ड वर्कर्स को रूस में रोजगार देने के लिए मोबिलिटी पैक्ट होने की संभावना है। ये इसलिए भी अहम है कि भारत के अब तक जर्मनी और इजराइल के साथ ही मोबिलिटी पैक्ट हैं। सिविल न्यूक्लियर डील भी अमेरिका और फ्रांस के साथ ही है। पुतिन की यात्रा के दौरान एनर्जी भी एक बड़ा मुद्दा रहेगा। रूस, भारत को सस्ता क्रूड ऑयल बेच रहा है, लेकिन अमेरिका और यूरोपीय देशों के दबाव के कारण पेमेंट में मुश्किलें आती रही हैं। दोनों देश एक नया पेमेंट सिस्टम बनाने पर सहमत हो सकते हैं, जिससे व्यापार बिना रुकावट चलता रहे। इसमें रुपया-रूबल ट्रेड, डिजिटल भुगतान या किसी तीसरे देश के बैंक का इस्तेमाल जैसे सिस्टम शामिल हो सकते हैं। इसके साथ ही रूस, भारत को आर्कटिक रीजन की एनर्जी परियोजनाओं में निवेश का मौका भी दे सकता है, जहां रूस दुनिया के बड़े तेल-गैस भंडार डेवलप कर रहा है। बीबीसी के मुताबिक पहले भारत, रूस से सिर्फ 2.5% तेल खरीदता था। लेकिन रूस-यूक्रेन जंग के बाद यह आंकड़ा बढ़कर 35% हो गया। इसकी वजह थी कि रूस पश्चिमी प्रतिबंधों की वजह से सस्ता तेल बेच रहा था। रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक भारत को इसका फायदा हुआ लेकिन अमेरिका को यह पसंद नहीं आया। ट्रम्प प्रशासन ने अगस्त में भारतीय सामान पर एक्स्ट्रा 25% टैरिफ लगा दिया। इसके बाद भारत ने रूसी तेल की खरीद कम कर दी। ऐसे में पुतिन चाहते हैं कि भारत दोबारा बढ़-चढ़कर तेल खरीदे। भारत और रूस के बीच 'स्पेशल एंड प्रिविलेज्ड स्ट्रैटेजिक पार्टनरशिप' साझेदारी है। इसके तहत दोनों देश लंबे समय से एक-दूसरे से हथियार, तकनीक और रक्षा सहयोग करते आए हैं। इसी रिश्ते के तहत Su-57 और S-500 जैसे आधुनिक हथियारों पर बात आगे बढ़ाई जा सकती है। भारतीय एयरफोर्स इस समय फाइटर जेट्स की कमी झेल रही है और उसके पास पहले से ही 200 से ज्यादा रूसी फाइटर जेट हैं। ऐसे में नेक्स्ट जेनरेशन के रूसी लड़ाकू विमान को अपनाना उसके लिए आसान होगा। सूत्रों का कहना है कि Su-57 में इतनी लंबी दूरी तक मार करने वाली मिसाइलें लगाई जा सकती हैं कि भारत की ताकत काफी बढ़ जाएगी। इसके अलावा हिंदुस्तान एयरोनॉटिक्स लिमिटेड (HAL) पहले से ही रूसी विमानों की मरम्मत और देखभाल करती रही है, इसलिए Su-57 जैसे नए जेट की सर्विसिंग भी भारत में आसानी से हो सकेगी। S-500 मिसाइल डिफेंस सिस्टम को लेकर भी भारत की दिलचस्पी बढ़ी है, क्योंकि यह लंबी दूरी से आने वाली मिसाइलों और हाइपरसोनिक मिसाइलों को भी रोक सकता है। मार्च 2023 में ICC ने पुतिन के खिलाफ अरेस्‍ट वारंट जारी किया था। कोर्ट ने यूक्रेन में बच्चों के अपहरण और डिपोर्टेशन के आरोपों के आधार पर पुतिन को वॉर क्राइम्स के लिए जिम्मेदार माना था। यह पहला मौका था जब ICC ने संयुक्त राष्ट्र सुरक्षा परिषद (UNSC) के किसी स्थायी सदस्य देश के टॉप लीडर के खिलाफ अरेस्‍ट वारंट जारी किया था। अमेरिका, रूस, चीन, ब्रिटेन और फ्रांस UNSC के स्थायी सदस्य हैं। इसके बाद से पुतिन दूसरे देशों की यात्राएं करने से बचते रहे हैं। वे पिछले साल G20 समिट में शामिल होने भारत नहीं आए थे। इस साल ब्राजील में हुई G20 समिट में भी हिस्सा नहीं लिया था। उनकी जगह विदेश मंत्री सर्गेई लावरोव दोनों कार्यक्रम में शामिल हुए। पुतिन ने आखिरी बार 6 दिसंबर 2021 को भारत की यात्रा की थी। तब वे सिर्फ 4 घंटे के लिए भारत आए थे। इस दौरान भारत और रूस के बीच 28 समझौतों पर दस्तखत हुए थे। इसमें मिलिट्री और तकनीकी समझौते थे। इस बार विजिट से दोनों देशों के बीच 2030 के लिए नए आर्थिक रोडमैप को आगे बढ़ाने की उम्मीद है। फिलहाल दोनों देशों के बीच करीब 60 अरब डॉलर का द्विपक्षीय व्यापार है। PM मोदी ने साल 2024 में दो बार रूस की यात्रा की थी। वे BRICS समिट के लिए 22 अक्टूबर को रूस गए थे। इससे पहले जुलाई में भी मोदी ने दो दिन का रूस दौरा किया था। तब उन्होंने पुतिन को भारत आने का न्योता दिया था। दोनों नेताओं के बीच इस साल आखिरी मुलाकात 1 सितम्बर को चीन के तियानजिन में SCO शिखर सम्मेलन के दौरान हुई थी। Copyright © 2024-25 DB

"पुतिन बोले- भारत खुशकिस्मत, उसके पास मोदी हैं: वह किसी के दबाव में नहीं आते, भारत की तरक्की से कई देश जलते हैं1:08","रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन ने पीएम मोदी की तारीफ करते हुए कहा कि भारत खुशकिस्मत है कि उसके पास मोदी हैं। वे किसी के दबाव में नहीं आते हैं। उन्होंने यह बात मॉस्को में आजतक को दिए इंटरव्यू में कही। पुतिन ने भारत को ग्रेट पावर बताया और कहा कि भारत की तरक्की कई देशों को चुभ रही है। उन्होंने पीएम मोदी की लीडरशिप, भारत-रूस संबंधों, ग्लोबल पॉलिटिक्स और अमेरिका की नीतियों पर खुलकर बात की। जब पुतिन से पूछा गया कि क्या अमेरिका भारत पर टैरिफ लगाकर राजनीतिक दबाव बनाने की कोशिश कर रहा है, तो पुतिन ने साफ कहा कि भारत अपनी इंडिपेंडेंट पॉलिसी पर चलता है। अमेरिका पर तंज कसते हुए पुतिन ने कहा कि वॉशिंगटन खुद हमसे न्यूक्लियर एनर्जी खरीदता है और फिर ज्ञान देने की कोशिश करता है। अमेरिका, भारत को रूस से तेल खरीदने पर दोषी ठहराने की कोशिश करता है। यह साफ तौर पर दोहरा रवैया है, जिसे अब दुनिया की बड़ी अर्थव्यवस्थाएं समझ रही हैं। रूसी राष्ट्रपति पुतिन भारत दौरे को लेकर गूगल पर ट्रेंड कर रहे हैं... सोर्स- गूगल ट्रेंड्स ------------------ पुतिन के इंटरव्यू से जुड़े अपडेट्स के लिए नीचे लाइव ब्लॉग से गुजर जाइए... जवाब- रूस के लोगों में भारतीय संस्कृति की छवि मनमोहक है। रूसी लोगों को भारतीय संगीत और फिल्में बेहद पसंद हैं। रूसी लोगों ने भारतीय संस्कृति को पूजा जैसी अहमियत दी। यह दिल से दिल का रिश्ता है। जवाब- हम भारत के प्रधानमंत्री मोदी के साथ काम कर रहे हैं। हमारे दोस्ताना संबंध हैं। वो ईमानदारी से काम कर रहे हैं। भारत के लोग खुशकिस्मत हैं। मोदी एक विश्वसनीय और ईमानदार नेता हैं। ऐसे ईमानदार व्यक्ति से बात करना बेहद सुखद है। उनकी बातचीत दिलचस्प होती है। जवाब- गाजा एक जटिल मुद्दा है जो लंबे समय से अनसुलझा है और किसी भी समझौते में जल्दबाजी नहीं की जानी चाहिए। यहां शासन व्यवस्था को इस तरह व्यवस्थित किया जाना चाहिए कि नियंत्रण फिलिस्तीनी लोगों के हाथों में जा सके। सभी देश फिलिस्तीन को लेकर चिंतित हैं। सभी चाहते हैं कि फिलिस्तीन राष्ट्र बने। ये कहना कि किसी ने कुछ नहीं किया, गलत होगा। ये समस्या दशकों से उलझी हुई है। इसका समाधान रातोंरात नहीं होगा। ट्रम्प ने जो किया है वो गाजा को दोबारा बसाने के लिए अच्छा है। जबाव- आपने अपनी आंखों से भेदभाव देखा, तभी तो उन्हें बताया। तालिबान से दूरी बनाने के बजाय उनसे संपर्क करना चाहिए। जिससे वह महिलाओं के साथ भेदभाव करना बंद कर दे। जवाब- हर देश में समस्याएं है। अफगानिस्तान में भी है। तालिबान ने अफगानिस्तान पर नियंत्रण पाया ये पहली वजह है। कई आतंकी संगठनों से वे निपट रहे हैं। ड्रग्स तस्कर संगठनों से वे लड़ रहे हैं। हमें पता होना चाहिए वहां क्या हो रहा है। इसलिए हमने उन्हें मान्यता दिया। जवाब- आतंकवाद के खिलाफ लड़ाई में रूस भारत के साथ है। ये बहुत आसान है। आजादी के लिए लड़ना है तो कानूनी तरीके से लड़ो। जवाब- दोनों देश हमारे करीबी दोस्त हैं। हमें उनके द्विपक्षीय मामलों में हस्तक्षेप नहीं करना चाहिए। पीएम मोदी और राष्ट्रपति जिनपिंग किसी नतीजे पर जरूर पहुंचेंगे। दोनों नेता तनाव कम करने के लिए कोशिश कर रहे हैं। भारत और चीन दोनों के नेता मेरे अच्छे दोस्त हैं। दोनों ही बुद्धिमान नेता हैं। वो मिलकर इसका हल निकाल लेंगे। जवाब- इसमें कोई बाधा नहीं है। यह अर्थव्यवस्था का मामला है। भारत ने कोई रुकावट पैदा नहीं की क्योंकि उन्हें तेल और उससे बने उत्पाद और उर्वरक चाहिए। पीएम मोदी हमारे सामने यह मुद्दा उठाते हैं। ये पेमेंट से जुड़ा मुद्दा नहीं है। मैंने अपने अफसरों को आदेश दिया है कि भारत से हम जो आयात करते हैं उसमें क्या और नया जोड़ सकते हैं उस पर काम करें। रूस भारत से ज्यादा सामान खरीदने की सोच रहा है, जिसका मकसद भारतीय आयात को बढ़ाना और दोनों देशों के बीच व्यापार असंतुलन को पाटना है। जवाब- हमें जल्दबाजी करने की कोई जरूरत नहीं है। रूस अभी ब्रिक्स मुद्रा बनाने की योजना नहीं बना रहा है। जल्दबाजी से कई बार गलती हो जाती है। आप यूरोप को देखिए, वहां अमेरिकी सिस्टम है। कई देश इसके लिए तैयार नहीं हैं। अपनी मुद्रा में हम आसानी से ट्रेड नहीं कर सकते हैं। हम जो करने जा रहे हैं, उसे सावधानी और समझदारी से करना होगा। हमें अपनी मुद्रा का इस्तेमाल करना चाहिए। मैं यह मानकर चल रहा हूं कि यह बेहद शानदार होने वाला है। इससे ग्लोबल साउथ के देशों का विकास होगा। हमारा लाभ भी होगा। आज के समय में इलेक्ट्रॉनिक पेमेंट सिस्टम का तेजी से विकास हो रहा है। ये किसी को खत्म करने के लिए नहीं हो रहा है। जवाब- देखिए बात यह है कि दुनिया हमेशा बदलती रहती है। हम वैश्विक बदलाव के गवाह है। हम इस बारे में एक घंटे बात कर सकते हैं, लेकिन आपकी जनता इस बातचीत से ऊब जाएगी। हालांकि मैं बता दूं ग्लोबल साउथ में तेजी से बदलाव हो रहे हैं। भारत ही नहीं, इंडोनेशिया भी तेजी से आगे बढ़ रहा है। यहां 30 करोड़ लोग हैं। ब्रिक्स, SCO जैसे दूसरे बड़े संगठन सामने आ रहे हैं। जवाब- सच बात यह है कि मैं इन बैठकों में जाना पहले ही बंद कर चुका था। मैं समझ नहीं पाता कि ये अपने को ग्रेट देश क्यों कहते हैं। आज भारत इनसे बड़ी अर्थव्यवस्था है। इन G7 देशों की अर्थव्यवस्था गिरती जा रही है। जर्मनी को ही देख लीजिए, 3 साल से मंदी झेल रहा है। मैंने विटकॉफ को समझाया कि मैंने G8 की बैठकों में जाना क्यों बंद किया। ये एक प्लेटफॉर्म है, इसे काम करने दीजिए। जवाब- नहीं जवाब- हम बस अपने हितों की रक्षा कर रहे हैं। हमें क्रीमिया पोर्ट को लेने की जरूरत नहीं, वो हमारा है। हमारी नौसेना यूक्रेन से समझौते के तहत वहां पहले से मौजूद थी। हमने क्रीमिया पोर्ट पर कब्जा नहीं किया। हम उन लोगों की मदद के लिए आगे बढ़ें जो अपने भविष्य को इनके हाथ में छोड़ चुके थे। जवाब- NATO एक अलग मसला है। हम कोई अनोखी मांग नहीं कर रहे। यूक्रेन समेत हर देश को अधिकार है कि उसे अपनी सुरक्षा कैसे करनी है। वो सोचता है कि NATO में शामिल होना उसकी सुरक्षा के लिए सही है, लेकिन हम सोचते हैं कि उसका NATO में शामिल होना हमारे लिए खतरा है। NATO ने कहा था कि वो पूरब की तरफ विस्तार नहीं करेगा, लेकिन फिर भी उसने किया। अब वो यूक्रेन को खुद में शामिल करना चाहता है। नाटो यूरोप और रूस दोनों के लिए खतरा है। वो हमारे खिलाफ एक सैन्य गठबंधन की तरह काम कर रहा है। यूक्रेन को तटस्थ रहना चाहिए। जवाब- जब जेलेंस्की सत्ता में आए थे तो उन्होंने कहा था कि वे हर हाल में शांति स्थापित करेंगे, लेकिन अब सब बदल चुका है। ये सरकार अपनी सोच से नाजी समर्थक है। इसलिए सारा माहौल युद्ध का बना। उनके लिए सबसे जरूरी है ये समझना कि शांतिपूर्ण बातचीत से हर समस्या का हल हो सकता है। ये बात हम उनको 2022 से समझाने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं। जवाब- जंग के दो ही समाधान हैं। या तो रूस जंग के जरिए रिपब्लिक को आजाद कर दे या यूक्रेन अपने सैनिकों को वापस बुला ले। हमने आठ सालों तक इन राज्यों को मान्यता नहीं दी थी। अब 8 सालों से हमने आजादी घोषित कर दी है, हम लोग यूक्रेन के बाकी हिस्सों और यूक्रेन के साथ रिश्ते बनाने की कोशिश कर रहे थे। जवाब- आप जानते हैं जैसा कि आपने कहा, बात जीत की नहीं है। बात इसकी है कि रूस अपनी रक्षा कर रहा है। ये हमारी रूसी भाषा और परंपरा की रक्षा की बात है जो उन क्षेत्रों में मौजूद है। यूक्रेन में रूसी ऑर्थोडॉक्स चर्चों को बंद कर दिया गया। हम युद्ध शुरू करने वालों में से नहीं थे। पश्चिम ने यूक्रेन के साथ मिलकर साजिश की और वहां तख्तापलट किया। हमने पूरे 8 साल शांति से इस मुद्दे को हल करने की कोशिश की। उन्होंने जंग के लिए यूक्रेन को हथियार दिया। जवाब- यूक्रेन को लेकर निश्चित तौर पर कह सकता हूं। वो ईमानदारी से शांतिपूर्ण समाधान खोज रहे हैं। ट्रम्प शत्रुता और मानव हानि रोकना चाहते हैं। उन्होंने मुझे कुछ चिट्ठियां दिखाईं। इन्हें अमेरिकी कंपनियों ने हमारे लिए लिखा था। वो तैयार है वापस रूस में आने के लिए। बहुत से लोग रूस वापस आना चाहते हैं। ट्रम्प का कंपनियों के लेटर लेकर आना बहुत अलग था। जवाब- हमें एहसास था कि राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प यूक्रेन जंग खत्म करवाना चाहतें हैं। अमेरिका और ट्रम्प के पास यह समझ है कि जंग खत्म होनी चाहिए। राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प हमेशा नुकसान को कम से कम रखना चाहते हैं। मुझे यकीन है अमेरिका समाधान खोज रहा है। जवाब- हम किसी के दबाब में नहीं आते। हम किसी के खिलाफ नहीं हैं। हम बस अपना हित चाहते हैं। दुनिया को इस कदम की सराहना करनी चाहिए। जवाब- मैं इसपर अभी खुलकर नहीं कह सकता। यह बात यात्रा के दौरान होगी। भारत हमारे सबसे भरोसेमंद साझेदारों में से एक है। हम सिर्फ हथियार बेच नहीं रहे। भारत सिर्फ खरीद नहीं रहा। भारत कई तरह के रूसी बख्तरबंद हथियारों का इस्तेमाल कर रहा है। T-90 टैंक, भारत में बन रही ब्रह्मोस मिसाइल इसका उदाहरण है। जवाब- मैं समझता हूं कि भारत से आज दुनिया का कोई भी देश वैसे बात नहीं कर सकता जैसे 77 साल पहले करता था। भारत आज एक शक्तिशाली देश है और वह पहले की तरह ब्रिटिश शासन के अधीन नहीं है। खासकर मोदी के शासन में वह किसी के दबाव में आने वाला नहीं है। भारत के लोग इस बात पर गर्व कर सकते हैं। जवाब- आप जिस दबाब की बात कर रहे हैं वो दरअसल राजनीति का इस्तेमाल कर आर्थिक हितों को साधने की कोशिश है। भारत के साथ हमारे रिश्तों पर इसका असर नहीं पड़ता। रूस ने भारत के तेल सेक्टर में निवेश किया है। हमारी कंपनी वहां रिफाइनरी पर काम कर रही है। भारत हमसे सस्ती कीमत पर तेल खरीद रहा है और यूरोप में बेच रहा है। यह बात लोगों को चुभ रही है, कि कैसे वह ऐसा कर रहा है। यह बात उन्हें चुभ रही है और इसके लिए वे नए हथकंडे अपना रहे हैं। हमारी एक बड़ी तेल कंपनी ने भारतीय तेल रिफाइनरी कंपनी का अधिग्रहण किया है। यह सबसे बड़े निवेश में से एक है। यहां 20 बिलियन डॉलर से ज्यादा का निवेश है। अमेरिका अब भी अपने न्यूक्लियर पावर प्लांट्स के लिए रूस से परमाणु ऊर्जा की खरीद करता है। इनमें अमेरिका में चल रहे न्यूक्लियर पावर प्लांट्स के लिए यूरेनियम भी शामिल है। अगर अमेरिका खुद अपनी ऊर्जा जरूरतें रूस के जरिए पूरी करता है तो फिर भारत की खरीद को लेकर उन्हें आपत्ति क्यों है? जवाब- भारत एक बहुत विशाल देश है। यह 150 करोड़ लोगों को देश है। जहां विकास की दर 7.7 है। यह मोदी के लिए बहुत बड़ी उपलब्धि है। आलोचना करने वाले कह सकते हैं कि इससे ज्यादा किया जा सकता है। लेकिन परिणाम सामने है। भारत-रूस एग्रीमेंट पर कोई जवाब नहीं दिया। उन्होंने कहा कि वे इसका ऐलान मोदी के साथ मिलकर करेंगे। जवाब- हम दोनों के बीच सामरिक विषयों पर ही बातचीत हुई। सामने मुझे मेरी कार दिखाई दी। मैंने उन्हें साथ चलने को कह दिया। वैसे ही जैसे दोस्तों के बीच होता है। हम दोनों ने दोस्तों की तरह ही बातचीत की। जवाब- पीएम मोदी के बारे में दुनिया तेजी से बदल रही है। वक्त के साथ इसके बदलने की रफ्तार तेज होती जा रही है। नए समीकरण और पावर सेंटर बन रहे हैं। ऐसे में महान देशों के बीच स्थिरता जरूरी है। चाहे ये दो देशों के बीच का का मामला हो या दुनिया को लेकर विकास के लिए शांति जरूरी है। पीएम के साथ हमारा आपसी सहयोग हमारे लक्ष्यों की गारंटी है। मेक इन इंडिया इसका बेहतरीन उदाहरण है। पीएम मोदी की सोच व्यावहारिक परिणाम देने वाली है। जवाब- मैं उम्मीद करता हूं आपको रूस आकर अच्छा लगा होगा। आप देख सकते हैं यहां सबकुछ ठीक है। मैं पीएम मोदी से मिलने को लेकर उत्सुक हूं। दोनों देशों के बीच रिश्तों का इतिहास अनोखा है। भारत ने कम समय में प्रगति की है। ये किसी बड़े चमत्कार से कम नहीं है। भारत में लोगों की जीवन प्रत्याशा दोगुनी से ज्यादा हो चुकी है। भारत के साथ संबंध नए आयाम छू रहे हैं। मुझे बहुत खुशी है कि मुझे पीएम मोदी के साथ मुलाकात का मौका मिल रहा है। यह सिर्फ व्यापार के लिए ही नहीं है। बल्कि व्यक्तिगत स्तर पर भी बहुत अहम है। पुतिन ने यह भी कहा कि उन्हें पीएम मोदी से मिलने का इंतजार है और वे भारत यात्रा को लेकर बेहद एक्साइटेड हैं। इससे पहले दोनों नेताओं ने 1 सितंबर को चीन के तियानजिन में SCO समिट के दौरान मुलाकात की थी। पुतिन ने SCO समिट का जिक्र करते हुए कहा कि वे और पीएम मोदी एक ही कार में साथ बैठे थे और यह उनका खुद का सुझाव था। उन्होंने बताया कि कार रुकने के बाद भी दोनों नेताओं ने काफी समय तक बातचीत की। पुतिन ने कहा- यह पहले से प्लान नहीं था। हम बाहर निकले, मेरी कार वहीं थी, और मैंने कहा कि हम साथ में चलें। यह कोई बहुत बड़ा प्लान नहीं था, हम बस दोस्तों की तरह कार में बैठ गए। हमने पूरे ड्राइव के दौरान बात की, हमेशा कुछ न कुछ बात होती है। हम बाद में काफी देर तक कार के अंदर भी बैठे रहे। पुतिन ने कहा कि इसमें किसी तरह का औपचारिकता नहीं थी, बल्कि दो मित्र देशों के नेताओं के बीच की बातचीत थी। भारत की आर्थिक प्रगति को लेकर पुतिन ने कहा कि देश की 7.7% की ग्रोथ रेट अपने आप में एक बड़ी कामयाबी है और यह पीएम मोदी की लीडरशिप का रिजल्ट है। भारत इस पर गर्व कर सकता है। उन्होंने कहा कि सिर्फ 77 सालों में भारत ने जिस तेजी से विकास किया है, वह पूरी दुनिया को प्रेरणा देता है। हमेशा कुछ ऐसे लोग होते हैं जो कहते हैं कि चीजें बेहतर की जा सकती थीं, लेकिन नतीजे खुद बोलते हैं। पुतिन ने यह भी बताया कि भारत और रूस के बीच होने वाले 90% व्यापारिक लेनदेन कामयाबी से पूरे हो चुके हैं। उन्होंने कहा कि ग्लोबल ऑर्डर अब एक मल्टी पोलर ढांचे की ओर बढ़ रही है, जिसमें भारत जैसी शक्तियों की भूमिका बेहद महत्वपूर्ण होगी। अपनी भारत यात्रा के दौरान होने वाले समझौतों पर बात करते हुए पुतिन ने बताया दोनों देशों में कई बड़े करार होने जा रहे हैं। इनमें स्पेस, सैटेलाइट तकनीक, न्यूक्लियर एनर्जी, एविएशन, न्यूक्लियर सबमरीन टेक्नीक, डिफेंस इंडस्ट्री और आर्टिफिशियल इंटेलिजेंस (AI) जैसे सेक्टर शामिल हैं। उन्होंने कहा कि ये तकनीक भविष्य के रिश्तों और आर्थिक सहयोग का आधार बनेंगी। पुतिन से जब पूछा गया कि क्या उन्हें अपने 25 साल के शासन में किसी बात का पछतावा है, तो उन्होंने कहा कि मैं कभी पीछे मुड़कर नहीं देखता और हमेशा आगे बढ़ने में भरोसा रखता हूं। Copyright © 2024-25 DB Corp ltd., All Rights Reserved This website follows the DNPA Code of

राहुल बोले- विदेशी मेहमानों से मिलने नहीं देती सरकार: नेता प्रतिपक्ष का पुतिन के दौरे से पहले बयान; कहा- यह मोदी की इनसिक्योरिटी1:35,"कांग्रेस नेता राहुल गांधी ने गुरुवार को आरोप लगाया कि सरकार, विदेश से आने वाले शीर्ष नेताओं (दिग्निटरीज) से मिलने नहीं देती। उनसे कहती है कि वे लोकसभा में नेता प्रतिपक्ष (LoP) से न मिलें। इसका कारण सरकार की असुरक्षा है। राहुल का यह बयान रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन के दो दिवसीय भारत दौरे से कुछ घंटे पहले आया। उन्होंने कहा, 'आमतौर पर परंपरा है कि विदेश से आने वाले नेता LoP से मिलते हैं। वाजपेयी जी के समय यह होता था, मनमोहन सिंह जी के समय भी होता था। लेकिन अब सरकार उन्हें यह संदेश देती है कि LoP से न मिलें। जब मैं विदेश जाता हूं तब भी यही किया जाता है। पीएम मोदी और विदेश मंत्रालय इस प्रोटोकॉल का पालन नहीं कर रहा राहुल ने कहा कि विपक्ष भारत का प्रतिनिधित्व करता है और उनका दृष्टिकोण जानना भी जरूरी होता है, लेकिन सरकार नहीं चाहती कि विपक्षी नेताओं की विदेश नेताओं से मुलाकात हो। जब पूछा गया कि सरकार ऐसा क्यों कर रही है, तो राहुल ने कहा, 'यह उनकी असुरक्षा है।' उधर रूस के राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमिर पुतिन 5-6 दिसंबर को भारत दौरे पर आ रहे हैं। वे करीब 30 घंटे तक भारत में रहेंगे। उनका यह दौरा भारत-रूस के बीच रणनीतिक संबंधों के 25 साल पूरे होने पर हो रहा है। संसद के शीतकालीन सत्र से जुड़े अपडेट्स के लिए नीचे लाइव ब्लॉग से गुजर जाइए... संसद ने तंबाकू और इससे जुड़े उत्पादों पर एक्साइज ड्यूटी बढ़ाने के प्रावधान वाले सेंट्रल एक्साइज (अमेंडमेंट) बिल, 2025 को मंजूरी दे दी। यह व्यवस्था जीएसटी कंपनसेशन सेस समाप्त होने के बाद लागू होगी। राज्यसभा में चर्चा का जवाब देते हुए वित्त मंत्री निर्मला सीतारमण ने कहा कि यह बिल कोई अतिरिक्त टैक्स नहीं लगाता, बल्कि तंबाकू उत्पादों पर जीएसटी ढांचे के तहत पहले से लागू कुल कर भार को बनाए रखने का साधन है। कांग्रेस नेता सोनिया गांधी ने केंद्र सरकार से दिल्ली प्रदूषण पर तुरंत एक्शन लेने की मांग की है। उन्होंने कहा- बच्चे मर रहे हैं, बुजुर्गों को भी सांस लेने में दिक्कत हो रही है। सरकार की जिम्मेदारी है कि कुछ करें, प्रधानमंत्री बयानबाजी बंद करें और समस्या का हल करें। केंद्रीय मंत्री जितेंद्र सिंह ने गुरुवार को लोकसभा में बताया कि एटॉमिक एनर्जी बिल 2025 का मसौदा एडवांस स्टेज में है। विभिन्न मंत्रालयों के सुझावों को शामिल करते हुए इसका विधिक परीक्षण चल रहा है। उन्होंने कहा कि मसौदा सभी प्रक्रियाओं से गुजरने के बाद ही इसकी अंतिम स्थिति स्पष्ट होगी। कांग्रेस सांसद कुमारी शैलजा ने राहुल गांधी के पुतिन से मिलने देने वाले बयान पर कहा- हमारी सरकार ने हमारी डेमोक्रेसी की परंपराओं को ताक पर रख दिया है। उन्हें डेमोक्रेसी या उसकी परंपराओं पर कोई भरोसा नहीं है। लोकसभा में हमारे विपक्ष के नेता राहुल गांधी हैं और राज्यसभा में मल्लिकार्जुन खड़गे हैं, लेकिन BJP सरकार ने इस परंपरा को कमजोर कर दिया है। और यह देश की इज्जत के लिए अच्छा संकेत नहीं है। कांग्रेस सांसद कार्ति चिदंबरम ने कहा- अमेरिकी डॉलर के मुकाबले रुपए का 90 पार जाना चिंता की बात है। इससे इम्पोर्ट महंगा होगा और आर्थिक दबाव बढ़ेगा। सरकार से मांग है कि वह व्हाइट पेपर जारी कर बताए कि राष्ट्रीय मुद्रा को मजबूत करने के लिए क्या कदम उठाए जा रहे हैं। भाजपा की राज्यसभा सांसद रेखा शर्मा ने कहा- यह सच है कि प्रदूषण है, लेकिन यह आज या कुछ दिनों का नहीं है। बल्कि यह कई सालों से चल रहा है। सरकार इसे लेकर सीरियस है और इस पर काम भी कर रही है। इतनी बड़ी समस्या को एक बार में हल नहीं किया जा सकता, लगातार कोशिशों की जरूरत होगी। उन्होंने कहा कि मुझे उम्मीद है कि अगले साल इस पर कुछ ठोस काम होगा और प्रदूषण कम होगा। अगर आप सोचते हैं कि कल एक सरकार गई और आज दूसरी सरकार इसे ठीक कर देगी, तो ऐसा नहीं होता। हर चीज में समय लगता है और जब काम इतना बड़ा हो, पिछले साल से हरियाणा में पराली जलना अब 90% कम हो गया है, लेकिन पंजाब में अभी भी लगातार पराली जल रही है। सदन की कार्यवाही शुरू होने से पहले विपक्षी सांसदों ने दिल्ली एयर पॉल्यूशन के मुद्दे पर चर्चा की मांग करते हुए संसद के मकर द्वार पर विरोध प्रदर्शन किया। कई विपक्षी सांसद गैस मास्क पहनकर पहुंचे। कांग्रेस सांसद प्रियंका गांधी वाड्रा ने कहा- हमें कौन सा मौसम एन्जॉय करना चाहिए? बाहर के हालात तो देखो। जैसा सोनिया जी ने कहा, बच्चे सांस नहीं ले पा रहे हैं। उन्हें अस्थमा है और उनके जैसे सीनियर सिटिजन को सांस लेने में दिक्कत हो रही है। हालात साल दर साल खराब होते जा रहे हैं। केंद्रीय सूचना एवं प्रसारण और आईटी मंत्री अश्विनी वैष्णव ने बुधवार को कहा था कि लोकसभा में केंद्रीय मंत्री अश्विनी वैष्णव ने कहा कि फेक न्यूज और एआई डीपफेक लोकतंत्र के लिए गंभीर खतरा है। सरकार फर्जी सूचना पर कार्रवाई के लिए नए कड़े नियम बना रही है। 36 घंटे में कंटेंट ‘टेकडाउन’ का नया नियम भी लागू किया गया है। संसदीय समिति की सिफारिशों के आधार पर नियमों को और मजबूत किया जाएगा। फ्रीडम ऑफ स्पीच और लोकतंत्र की सुरक्षा के बीच संतुलन रखते हुए कार्रवाई जारी रहेगी। कांग्रेस सांसद शशि थरूर ने कहा- लीडर ऑफ अपोजिशन राहुल गांधी ने पुतिन वाले मामले पर अपनी बात कह ही है। मुझे लगता है कि सरकार को जवाब देना चाहिए। एक डेमोक्रेसी में यह अच्छा होगा कि आने वाले बड़े लोग (विदेशी मेहमान) सबसे मिलें। मुझे लगता है कि यह एक जरूरी विजिट है। हमारे देश में बिना किसी शक के रूस, चीन और US के साथ कई जरूरी बाइलेटरल रिलेशन बनाए रखने की जरूरत है। हम यह बात नहीं मान सकते कि एक रिश्ता दूसरे रिश्ते के नेचर से तय होना चाहिए। कांग्रेस MP मनीष तिवारी ने कहा- मैंने आज दिल्ली के एयर पॉल्यूशन पर चर्चा की मांग करते हुए सस्पेंशन ऑफ बिजनेस का नोटिस दिया है। लोगों को बहुत परेशानी हो रही है। बच्चों को सांस लेने में दिक्कत हो रही है। यह एक बहुत बड़ा हेल्थ क्राइसिस है। डॉलर के मुकाबले रुपये के रेट पर उन्होंने कहा- यह बहुत अजीब बात है कि जब रुपया 60 से कम था, तो वे डॉ. मनमोहन सिंह और सोनिया गांधी के जमाने की बात करते थे, लेकिन अब रुपया 90 पर पहुंच गया है, अब यह किस जमाने से मुकाबला कर रहा है। कांग्रेस सांसद प्रियंका गांधी वाड्रा ने कहा- कुछ साल पहले जब मनमोहन सिंह के समय में रुपया के मुकाबले जब डॉलर की कीमत बढ़ी थी तब बीजेपी इसे मुद्दा बनाया था। अब डॉलर के मुकाबले रुपया 90 के पार है। इस पर उनका जवाब है। US डॉलर के मुकाबले रुपए की कीमत में गिरावट पर कांग्रेस चीफ और राज्यसभा सांसद मल्लिकार्जुन खड़गे ने कहा- मैंने कहा है कि रुपए की कीमत कम हो रही है, इसका मतलब है कि इस देश की आर्थिक हालत अच्छी नहीं है। वे हमेशा कहते हैं कि हम डेवलप कर रहे हैं और आर्थिक हालत अच्छी है। लेकिन जब रुपया गिरता है, तो यह दिखाता है कि आपकी आर्थिक हालत क्या है। स्पीकर ने जांच के लिए 3 सदस्यीय कमेटी का ऐलान किया था। इसमें सुप्रीम कोर्ट, हाईकोर्ट के 1-1 जज और 1 कानूनविद शामिल हैं। शीतकालीन सत्र में जांच समिति की अपनी रिपोर्ट रखेगी। अगर जस्टिस वर्मा पर आरोप साबित होते हैं तो संसद में वोटिंग के लिए महाभियोग प्रस्ताव पेश होगा। प्रस्ताव के समर्थन में अगर दो तिहाई वोट पड़ेंगे तो प्रस्ताव पास हो जाएगा और राष्ट्रपति की मंजूरी के लिए जाएगा। हालांकि, आशंका जताई जा रही है कि जांच समिति की रिपोर्ट में आरोप तय हुए तो जस्टिस वर्मा खुद इस्तीफा दे सकते हैं। बैठक के बाद कांग्रेस, TMC, सपा, DMK, राजद समेत 8 विपक्षी दलों ने संयुक्त प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस की। इसमें TMC महासचिव अभिषेक बनर्जी ने कहा था- संसद के मौजूदा सत्र (मानसून सत्र) में 3 दिन बाकी हैं। महाभियोग लाने के लिए 14 दिन पहले नोटिस देना जरूरी है। CEC के रवैये को देखते हुए हम अगले सत्र (शीतकालीन सत्र) में नोटिस देंगे। दरअसल राहुल गांधी चुनाव आयोग पर वोट चोरी के आरोप में अब तक तीन प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस (4 नवंबर, 18 सितंबर, 7 अगस्त) कर चुके हैं। उन्होंने आयोग को मोदी सरकार की “B टीम” भी कहा था। भाजपा के साथ वोट चोरी करने का आरोप लगाया था। संसद के शीतकालीन सत्र में 10 नए बिल पेश होंगे। लोकसभा बुलेटिन में शनिवार (22 नवंबर) को इसकी जानकारी दी गई थी। इनमें सबसे अहम एटॉमिक एनर्जी बिल है, जिसके तहत पहली बार निजी कंपनियों (भारतीय और विदेशी) को न्यूक्लियर पावर प्लांट लगाने की अनुमति देने का प्रस्ताव है। फिलहाल देश में सभी परमाणु संयंत्र सरकार के नियंत्रण वाली कंपनियां जैसे NPCIL ही बनाती और चलाती हैं। बिल पास होने पर निजी क्षेत्र को भी न्यूक्लियर पावर प्रोडक्शन में प्रवेश मिलेगा। सत्र में आने वाला दूसरा बड़ा बिल ‘हायर एजुकेशन कमीशन ऑफ इंडिया’ बिल होगा। इसमें UGC, AICTE और NCTE जैसे अलग-अलग रेगुलेटरी संस्थानों को खत्म करके एक ही राष्ट्रीय कमीशन बनाने की योजना है। सरकार का कहना है कि इससे उच्च शिक्षा व्यवस्था अधिक सुगम और प्रभावी होगी। अहम बिल जो पेश होंगे, उनसे क्या बदलाव सरकार ने लोकसभा को बताया है कि 5 साल में 2,04,268 प्राइवेट कंपनियां बंद हो गई हैं। कॉर्पोरेट मामलों के राज्य मंत्री हर्ष मल्होत्रा द्वारा पेश किए गए आंकड़ों के मुताबिक सबसे अधिक कंपनियां 2022-23 में (83,452) बंद हुईं, इसके बाद 2021-22 में 64,054 और 2023-24 में 21,181 कंपनियां बंद हुईं। पर्यावरण मंत्री भूपेंद्र यादव ने लोकसभा को बताया कि पंजाब और हरियाणा में 2025 के धान कटाई के मौसम के दौरान पराली जलाने की घटनाओं में 2022 की तुलना में लगभग 90 प्रतिशत की कमी आई है। दूरसंचार विभाग का यह आदेश कि मोबाइल कंपनियां और आयातक ‘संचार साथी’ एप को फोन में पहले से इंस्टॉल करें और उसे हटाया भी न जा सके। यह लोगों की गोपनीयता पर सीधा हमला है। रेणुका चौधरी ने आरोप लगाया कि ऐसा कदम निगरानी बढ़ाने का रास्ता खोलता है और इससे लोगों की हर गतिविधि, बातचीत और फैसले लगातार निगरानी में रहने का खतरा पैदा हो जाता है। उन्होंने कहा कि इसके लिए न पर्याप्त सुरक्षा इंतजाम हैं और न ही कोई संसदीय निगरानी। 1 दिसंबर- वित्त मंत्री ने 3 बिल पेश किए, मणिपुर GST बिल पास संसद के शीतकालीन सत्र में पहले दिन वित्त मंत्री निर्मला सीतारमण ने लोकसभा में तीन बिल पेश किए, जिसमें से मणिपुर गुड्स एंड सर्विस टैक्स बिल (दूसरा संशोधन) विधेयक, 2025 बिल पास हुआ। इसके अलावा उन्होंने केंद्रीय उत्पाद शुल्क (संशोधन) विधेयक, 2025 और स्वास्थ्य सुरक्षा और राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा सेस विधेयक, 2025 भी लोकसभा में पेश किए थे। पूरी खबर पढ़ें... 2

"भास्कर एक्सप्लेनरपुतिन का 60 साल में तलाक, 31 साल छोटी गर्लफ्रेंड: बच्चों को ब्रिटेन से पढ़ाने आते हैं टीचर; रूसी राष्ट्रपति की सीक्रेट फैमिली3:47","रूस के राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन 2 दिन के दौरे पर भारत आ रहे हैं। उनके साथ करीब 100 लोगों की टीम है, लेकिन इसमें परिवार का एक भी सदस्य नहीं है। 2012 में आखिरी बार पुतिन अपनी पत्नी के साथ दिखे थे। इसके बाद विदेश दौरे तो क्या रूस में भी पुतिन का परिवा भास्कर एक्सप्लेनर में जानेंगे पुतिन की बीवी, गर्लफ्रेंड, बच्चों समेत सीक्रेट फैमिली की पूरी कहानी... वर्ल्ड वॉर-2 के दौरान सोवियत यूनियन के लेनिनग्राद (अब सेंट पीटर्सबर्ग) शहर को जर्मन सेना ने 872 दिनों तक सीज कर रखा था। यहां इतनी ताबड़तोड़ बमबारी हुई कि शहर पूरी तरह से तबाह हो गया। इसी शहर में 7 अक्टूबर 1952 को व्लादिमीर पुतिन का जन्म हुआ। उनके पिता व्लादिमीर स्पिरिडोनोविच, सोवियत नेवी में थे और मां मारिया इवानोव्ना पुतिन एक फैक्ट्री में काम किया करती थीं। पुतिन के दादा सोवियत नेता व्लादिमीर लेनिन और जोसेफ स्टालिन के चीफ शेफ रह चुके थे। पुतिन अपने माता-पिता की इकलौती जिंदा संतान हैं। वर्ल्ड वॉर शुरू होने से पहले उनके सबसे बड़े भाई अल्बर्ट की मौत हो गई थी। युद्ध के बाद जब शहर तबाह हो गया तो छोटे बच्चों को भुखमरी से बचाने अनाथालय भेजा जा रहा था। पुतिन के दूसरे भाई विक्टर को भी ले जाया गया, लेकिन यहां उसकी मौत हो गई। परिवार को यह भी नहीं पता चल पाया कि उसे कहां दफनाया गया है। जंग में जब शहर तबाह हुआ तो पुतिन का परिवार बहुत गरीब हो गया। वे लोग लेनिनग्राद के कम्युनल अपार्टमेंट में रहने लगे। बिल्डिंग के पांचवे फ्लोर पर उनका एक कमरे का घर था। यहां कई परिवारों के साथ किचन और बाथरूम शेयर करना पड़ता। जब पुतिन 12 साल के हुए तो उन्होंने सोवियत रेड आर्मी ने मार्शल आर्ट्स सैम्बो और जूडो की क्लास जॉइन कर ली। पुतिन की मां को ये फैसला पसंद नहीं आया। पुतिन की ऑफिशियल बायोग्राफी के मुताबिक, ‘जब भी पुतिन जूडो क्लास के लिए घर से निकलते तो उनकी मां बड़बड़ाते हुए कहतीं कि फिर से अपनी फाइट के लिए जा रहा है।’ पुतिन बचपन से ही सीक्रेट एजेंट बनना चाहते थे। 23 साल की उम्र में उन्होंने रूस की खुफिया एजेंसी KGB जॉइन भी कर ली। इसी बीच एक मूवी शो के दौरान पुतिन के दोस्त ने उन्हें एयरहोस्टेस ल्यूडमिला ओचेरत्नाया से मिलवाया। पुतिन को ल्यूडमिला बहुत अच्छी लगीं और वो दोनों अक्सर मिलने लगे। 1983 में दोनों ने शादी कर ली। ल्यूडमिला कहती हैं, व्लादिमीर में कुछ ऐसा था, जिसने मुझे आकर्षित किया। 3-4 महीने बाद मुझे एहसास हो गया कि ऐसे ही इंसान की मुझे जरूरत थी। KGB के काम से पुतिन को जर्मनी शिफ्ट होना पड़ा तो ल्यूडमिला भी उनके साथ चली गईं। 1990 में पुतिन वापस रूस आ गए और 1996 में उनका राजनीतिक करियर शुरू हो गया। 1999 में वो रूस के प्रधानमंत्री और 2000 में राष्ट्रपति बने। पुतिन की बायोग्राफी लिखने वालीं नताल्या गेवोरक्यान 1999 में ल्यूडमिला से मिली थीं। इस मुलाकात के बारे में वो बताती हैं, पुतिन की शादी में प्यार खत्म हो चुका था। उनकी पत्नी को लगता था कि पुतिन उनसे प्यार नहीं करते। ल्यूडमिला ने उस समय कहा था, 'कुछ औरतें ऐसी होती हैं जिनकी मर्द तारीफ करते हैं। मुझे लगता है मैं उस तरह की औरत नहीं हूं। वो मुझे अपनी बाहों में नहीं लेंगे।' पुतिन के पहले कार्यकाल के दौरान ल्यूडमिला लगभग सभी विदेश यात्राओं में उनके साथ गईं, लेकिन दूसरे कार्यकाल में पुतिन हमेशा अकेले ही दिखे। इस दौरान उनके दूसरी लड़कियों से अफेयर की अफवाह उड़ी, लेकिन पुतिन इन्हें खारिज करते रहे। 2013 में आखिरकार दोनों की दूरियां पब्लिक के सामने आ गई। तब 60 साल के पुतिन ने बताया कि वो और ल्यूडमिला अलग हो गए हैं। उनकी पत्नी ने कहा, 'हम दोनों मुश्किल से मिल पाते हैं, इसलिए हम अलग हो रहे हैं। ये हम दोनों का साझा फैसला है।' शादी के दो साल बाद पुतिन की बड़ी बेटी मारिया वोरोत्सोवा का जन्म हुआ और जर्मनी जाकर 1986 में छोटी बेटी कैटरीना तिखोनोवा पैदा हुई। पुतिन ने अपनी दोनों बेटियों के नाम अपनी मां के नाम पर रखे हैं। जब पुतिन प्रधानमंत्री बने तो उनका परिवार आइसोलेशन में चला गया। सुरक्षा के चलते उनकी बेटियों की पढ़ाई भी घर में कराई जाने लगी। हर समय उनके चारों और बॉडीगार्ड्स रहते। दोनों का यूनिवर्सिटी में एडमिशन भी नकली नामों से हुआ। पुतिन ने अपनी बेटियों के बारे में पब्लिकली बस इतना बताया, मेरी दोनों बेटियों की पढ़ाई रूस में ही हुई है। वो मॉस्को में ही रहती हैं। नताल्या गेवोरक्यान के मुताबिक पुतिन की बेटियां उनका बहुत सम्मान करती थीं लेकिन उन्हें अपने पिता के साथ कभी ज्यादा वक्त नहीं मिल पाता। कैटरीना एक रॉक-एन-रोल डांसर रही हैं और इंटरनेशनल लेवल पर कई डांस पर्फोमेंस कर चुकी हैं। वहीं मारिया ने मेडिसिन की पढ़ाई की है और अब एक मेडिकल रिसर्चर और बिजनेस वुमन हैं। रॉयटर्स के मुताबिक, वो एक अरबपति हैं। रूस से युद्ध शुरू होने के बाद वहां के टेलिग्राम चैनलों पर यह खबर भी चली की मारिया बॉर्डर के पास जवानों के लिए फील्ड हॉस्पिटल बनाने पहुंची हैं। उन्होंने वहां कई घायल सिपाहियों का इलाज भी किया। दोनों ही बेटियां अपने पति और बच्चों के साथ रहती हैं। 2017 में एक इंटरव्यू में पुतिन में बताया था कि उनके नाती-नातिन भी हैं, लेकिन वो चाहते है कि बच्चे आम जिंदगी जिएं। कई मीडिया रिपोर्ट्स के मुताबिक पुतिन कि एक 22 साल की नाजायज बेटी एलिजावेटा ओलेगोवना भी है। यूक्रेन युद्ध शुरू होने के बाद से वो पेरिस में रह रही है। उसने अपना सोशल मीडिया अकाउंट भी डिएक्टिवेट कर दिया है। 2000 के दशक में एक तरफ पुतिन की उनकी पत्नी से अलग होने की खबरें आने लगी थी। वहीं दूसरी तरफ उनके रूस की जिमनास्टिक में ओलिंपिक गोल्ड मेडलिस्ट एलिना काबेवा से अफेयर के भी चर्चे थे। काबेवा जिस साल पैदा हुई थीं, उसी साल पुतिन ने शादी की थी। 42 साल की काबेवा, पुतिन से 31 साल छोटी है। 2008 में एक शो में काबेवा ने बताया था कि उन्हें अपना 'मिस्टर परफेक्ट' मिल चुका है, लेकिन वो उसका नाम नहीं बता सकतीं। इसी इंटरव्यू में उनसे पूछा गया कि क्या वो अपने प्यार के लिए किसी पत्नी से उसका पति छीन सकती हैं? इस पर काबेवा ने जवाब दिया कि अगर किसी शादी में पहले से ही समस्या है और पुरुष दूसरी स्त्री को तवज्जो दे रहा है तो ऐसा करने में कोई बुराई नहीं है। 2011 के बाद से काबेवा के हाथ में हमेशा एक एंगेजमेंट रिंग दिखी है। द डोजियर सेंटर की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, इसके बाद से पुतिन के दोस्तों की तरफ से काबेवा और उनके परिवार को कई प्रॉपर्टी गिफ्ट में मिलने लगी। हालांकि दोनों ने शादी की है या नहीं, इसकी जानकारी नहीं मिल पाई। काबेवा रूस की संसद की सदस्य रह चुकी हैं। 2014 में उन्हें रूस के नेशनल मीडिया ग्रुप का बोर्ड ऑफ डायरेक्टर बना दिया गया। बिना अनुभव इस पद पर चुना जाना काफी विवादित रहा। डोजियर की रिपोर्ट की मुताबिक, 2014 में काबेवा स्विट्जरलैंड गई। यहीं 2015 में रूसी मूल की डॉक्टर ने उनकी डिलीवरी कराई। इसी डॉक्टर ने स्विट्जरलैंड में ही 2019 में उनके दूसरे बेटे की डिलीवरी कराई थी। डोजियर के सूत्रों के मुताबिक ये दोनों बेटे व्लादिमीर पुतिन के हैं। बड़े बेटे का नाम इवान पुतिन और छोटे का व्लादिमीर पुतिन जूनियर है। अब काबेवा बच्चों और युवाओं को जिमनास्टिक सिखाती हैं। डोजियर सेंटर की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, पुतिन ने अपने दोनों बेटों को पूरी तरह से छिपा कर रखा है। स्टेट डेटाबेस में उनके नाम नहीं है। इनके नकली दस्तावेज बनाए गए हैं, जोकि आमतौर पर जासूसों के लिए बनाए जाते हैं। बच्चों की सुरक्षा के लिए उनके आस-पास हर समय पुतिन के ही बॉडीगार्ड तैनात रहते हैं। उनकी पढ़ाई भी घर पर ही होती है। बच्चों की देखरेख और पढ़ाई के लिए स्टाफ भी पुतिन के दोस्तों की कंपनियों के जरिए हायर किए जाते हैं। 2024 में एक इंग्लिश नैनी एजेंसी ने विज्ञापन छापा था- सेंट पीटर्सबर्ग में 4 और 8 साल के दो लड़कों के लिए इंग्लिश टीचर की जरूरत है। परिवार आइसोलेशन में रहता है। साउथ अफ्रीकी पासपोर्ट धारक को तवज्जो दी जाएगी। टीचर को भी आइसोलेशन में रहकर ही पढ़ाना होगा। नौकरी शुरू करने से पहले दो हफ्ते तक मेडिकल जांच होगी। समय-समय पर नैनी एजेंसी इस तरह के विज्ञापन छापती रहती है। डोजियर सेंटर के मुताबिक ये विज्ञापन पुतिन के बेटों के लिए ही टीचर हायर करने के हैं। रूस के साउथ अफ्रीका से अच्छे राजनीतिक संबंध होने के कारण पुतिन अपने बच्चों को किसी साउथ अफ्रीकी से अंग्रेजी सिखाना सुरक्षित समझते हैं। ब्रिटेन और न्यूजीलैंड के टीचर भी इन्हें पढ़ा चुके हैं। पुतिन के बेटे अपने घर से बाहर भी नहीं निकल सकते। पुतिन के आधिकारिक आवास के पास ही एक इमारत में उनके बच्चे और स्टाफ रहता है। यहां वे सुबह 8-9 बजे आते हैं। दिन भर पढ़ाई, खेल-कूद और बाकी एक्टिविटी होती है। रात में दोनों अपने माता-पिता के पास आ जाते हैं। यह दोनों इमारतों के बीच कुछ मीटर का अंतर होने के बावजूद दोनों बेटों को हमेशा गाड़ी में ही ट्रैवल करना होता है। कभी-कभी बच्चों से मिलने काबेवा के दोस्तों के बच्चे आ जाते हैं। हालांकि इन्हें भी इवान और व्लादिमीर जूनियर से मिलने से पहले दो हफ्ते क्वारैंटाइन में रहना पड़ता है। डोजियर की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक कई बार पुतिन अपने बच्चों के साथ शाम को खेलते भी हैं। पुतिन और उनके बेटे इवान के हॉकी खेलने के लिए पुतिन के आवास के पास ही एक हॉकी फील्ड भी तैयार की गई है। इस गेम में पिता-पुत्र के अलावा सिर्फ पुतिन के बॉडीगार्ड हिस्सा लेते हैं। इवान को हॉकी सिखाने कोच भी आते हैं। अपनी फेक आईडी के जरिए वो कई प्रतियोगिताओं में हिस्सा भी लेते हैं। पुतिन अपने बच्चों के साथ कई मौकों पर सीक्रेट ट्रिप पर भी जाते हैं। इसके लिए वो अपने पर्सनल एयरक्राफ्ट, ट्रेन या फिर याट का इस्तेमाल करते हैं। कई बार इन ट्रिप्स पर बच्चों के टीचर भी साथ होते हैं। पुतिन अपने बच्चों के टीचर्स के लिए अलग से भी ट्रिप प्लान करते हैं। **** References and further reading...

"अमेरिका में पाकिस्तानी PM-आर्मी चीफ पर बैन लगाने की मांग: 44 अमेरिकी सांसदों ने विदेश मंत्री को चिट्ठी लिखी, कहा- पाकिस्तान में तानाशाही बढ़ रही1:07","अमेरिकी संसद के 44 सांसदों ने बुधवार को विदेश मंत्री मार्को रुबियो को चिठ्ठी लिखकर पाकिस्तान के प्रधानमंत्री शहबाज शरीफ और आर्मी चीफ आसिम मुनीर पर तत्काल प्रतिबंध लगाने की मांग की है। इन सांसदों का आरोप है कि पाकिस्तान में सेना सरकार चला रही है। देश में आम लोगों के अधिकारों का बड़े पैमाने पर हनन हो रहा है। विदेश में रहने वाले पाकिस्तानी मूल के अमेरिकी नागरिकों को भी सरकार के खिलाफ आवाज उठाने पर धमकियां दी जा रही हैं। यह चिठ्ठी डेमोक्रेटिक महिला सांसद प्रमिला जयपाल और सांसद ग्रेग कासर के नेतृत्व में लिखी गई है। इसमें सांसदों ने कहा कि पाकिस्तान में तानाशाही बढ़ रही है। पत्रकारों को धमकाया जा रहा है, अगवा किया जा रहा है या देश छोड़ने पर मजबूर किया जा रहा है। आलोचना पर पत्रकार के परिवार को अगवा किया सांसदों ने चिठ्ठी में कुछ घटनाओं का जिक्र किया है। इनमें वर्जीनिया के जर्नलिस्ट अहमद नूरानी का मामला शामिल है। नूरानी ने पाकिस्तानी सेना के भ्रष्टाचार पर रिपोर्टिंग की थी। इसके बाद पाकिस्तान में रहने वाले उनके दोनों भाइयों को एक महीने से ज्यादा समय तक अगवा करके रखा गया था। इसी तरह मशहूर संगीतकार सलमान अहमद के जीजा का भी अपहरण हुआ था, जिन्हें अमेरिकी हस्तक्षेप के बाद ही छोड़ा गया। चिठ्ठी में सांसदों ने पाकिस्तान में बढ़ते तानाशाही संकट को लेकर चिंता जताई है। उनके अनुसार विपक्षी नेता बिना आरोप के जेल में डाले जा रहे हैं। आम नागरिकों को सिर्फ सोशल मीडिया पोस्ट पर गिरफ्तार किया जा रहा है। महिलाओं, धार्मिक अल्पसंख्यकों और खासकर बलूचिस्तान के लोगों पर सबसे ज्यादा अत्याचार हो रहे हैं। चिठ्ठी में 2024 के चुनावों में हुई धांधली का जिक्र, जांच की मांग सांसदों ने 2024 के आम चुनावों में हुई धांधली का भी जिक्र किया, जिस पर स्वतंत्र पाकिस्तानी संस्था की ‘पट्टन रिपोर्ट’ के अलावा खुद अमेरिकी विदेश विभाग ने भी गहरी चिंता जताई थी और पूरी जांच की मांग की थी। चिठ्ठी में कहा गया कि 2024 के पाकिस्तानी चुनावों में भयंकर धांधली हुई थी। इसकी पूरी दुनिया ने निंदा की और एक स्वतंत्र पाकिस्तानी संस्था की ‘पट्टन रिपोर्ट’ में सारी गड़बड़ियों का सबूत के साथ दस्तावेज तैयार किया गया है। इन चुनावों के जरिए सिर्फ एक कठपुतली सरकार बनाई गई है, जो बाहर से सही लगती है लेकिन असल में इसे सेना चलाती है। अमेरिका के विदेश विभाग ने भी उस समय कहा था कि चुनाव में बहुत बड़ी गड़बड़ी हुई है और इसकी पूरी जांच होनी चाहिए। अब हालत यह है कि सेना के दबाव में पाकिस्तान की सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने यह फैसला सुना दिया कि आम नागरिकों का केस भी सैन्य अदालतों में चल सकता है। इससे अदालतें पूरी तरह सेना के कंट्रोल में आ गई हैं और जो अधिकारी या जनरल जुल्म करते हैं, उन्हें सजा मिलने का कोई रास्ता ही नहीं बचा। क्या प्रतिबंध लग सकते हैं सांसदों के पत्र के अनुसार, शरीफ और मुनीर सहित वरिष्ठ पाकिस्तानी अधिकारियों पर प्रतिबंध लगाए जा सकते हैं, जो अमेरिकी कानूनों के तहत संभव हैं: एक साल में आसिम मुनीर से दो बार मिले ट्रम्प आसिम मुनीर 2025 में दो बार अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प से मिल चुके हैं। 18 जून को ट्रम्प ने उन्हें लंच के लिए व्हाइट हाउस बुलाया था। इस दौरान दोनों ने बंद कमरे में बैठक की थी। अमेरिकी-पाकिस्तानी नागरिकों ने मुनीर के खिलाफ नारेबाजी करते हुए उन्हें तानाशाह और कातिल बताया था। इसके बाद पाकिस्तानी पीएम शहबाज शरीफ और आर्मी चीफ आसिम मुनीर ने सितंबर में ट्रम्प से मुलाकात की थी। तीनों के बीच करीब 1 घंटा 20 मिनट तक बैठक चली। इमरान खान की रिहाई की मांग की गई अमेरिकी सांसदों ने पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री इमरान खान और दूसरे राजनीतिक कैदियों की रिहाई की भी मांग की। उन्होंने कहा कि हम प्रशासन से आग्रह करते हैं कि जो अधिकारी नागरिकों की कानूनी आजादी को कमजोर कर रहे हैं, उनके खिलाफ सख्त कदम उठाए जाएं। सांसदों ने आगे कहा कि ऐसे कदम मानवाधिकारों के तरफ अमेरिका की जवाबदेही को दिखाएंगे। पाकिस्तानी अमेरिकी नागरिकों को अंतरराष्ट्रीय दमन से बचाएंगे और क्षेत्रीय स्थिरता को बढ़ावा देंगे। मौत की अफवाहों के बाद इमरान से मिला था परिवार इमरान खान पिछले दो साल से ज्यादा समय से जेल में बंद है। पिछले कुछ दिनों से इमरान के परिवार को उनसे मिलने नहीं दिया जा रहा था। इसके बाद उनकी मौत की अफवाहें फैल गई। नवंबर की शुरुआत में इमरान खान के समर्थक और परिवार वाले उनसे मिलने पहुंचे थे, लेकिन जेल प्रशासन ने उन्हें इजाजत नहीं दी। इसके बाद रावलपिंडी और इस्लामाबाद में हिंसा बढ़ गई। बढ़ते प्रदर्शन को देखते हुए इमरान खान के परिवार को 27 दिन बाद 2 दिसंबर को उनसे मिलने की इजाजत दी गई। मुनीर को सेना का सुप्रीम बनाने से बच रहे शहबाज यह चिठ्ठी पाकिस्तान में 12 नवंबर को हुए 27वें संवैधानिक संशोधन के बाद सामने आया है। यह संशोधन सेना की ताकत बढ़ाने और कोर्ट के अधिकारों को कम करने के लिए किया गया था। पाकिस्तान समेत दुनियाभर ने इस फैसले की आलोचना की थी और इसे आम लोगों की आजादी छिनने और सत्ता सेना को सौंपने वाला कदम बताया था। यूनाइटेड नेशन भी इसपर चिंता जता चुका है। इसके तहत फील्ड मार्शल आसिम मुनीर चीफ ऑफ डिफेंस फोर्सेस (CDF) बनाए जाते। हालांकि, अभी तक मुनीर चीफ ऑफ डिफेंस फोर्सेस (CDF) नहीं बन पाए हैं। इसके लिए 29 नवंबर को नोटिफिकेशन जारी होना था, लेकिन 5 दिन बाद भी यह पद खाली पड़ा है। PM शहबाज शरीफ ने अब तक इस आदेश वाले नोटिफिकेशन पर साइन नहीं किए हैं। साइन करने से पहले ही शहबाज बहरीन फिर लंदन की यात्रा पर चले गए थे। ------------------------------------ ये खबर भी पढ़ें... इमरान की बहन बोलीं- आसिम मुनीर कट्टरपंथी: इस्लाम न मानने वालों से लड़ते हैं, इमरान

"ग्राउंड रिपोर्ट‘पति रूसी सेना में फंसे, सरकार पुतिन से वापस मांगे’: 44 भारतीय वॉर जोन में, परिवार परेशान; रूसी राष्ट्रपति के भारत दौरे से उम्मीद3:58","‘मेरे पति नौकरी के लिए रूस गए थे। वहां उन्हें धोखे से जंग में भेज दिया। 15 अक्टूबर को उनसे आखिरी बार बात हुई थी। उन्होंने कहा था कि अगर तीन दिन तक कॉल न आए, तो समझ लेना कि मैं नहीं हूं। अब उनसे कोई कॉन्टैक्ट नहीं है। रूस के राष्ट्रपति भारत आ रहे हैं। जयपुर की रहने वाली दिव्या अपने पति को बचाने के लिए ये गुहार लगा रही हैं। उनके पति मनोज सिंह शेखावत जून, 2025 में रूस गए थे। वहां उन्हें जबरन रूसी सेना के साथ यूक्रेन के बॉर्डर पर भेज दिया गया। रूस-यूक्रेन के बीच करीब 4 साल से जंग चल रही है। रूसी सेना में कितने भारतीय हैं, इसके अलग-अलग नंबर हैं। विदेश मंत्रालय ने 7 नवंबर को बताया था कि 44 भारतीय रूसी सेना में हैं। वहीं, सांसद हनुमान बेनीवाल ने लोकसभा में ये संख्या 61 बताई है। 4 दिसंबर को रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन दो दिन के लिए भारत आ रहे हैं। इसकी खबर लगते ही रूस में फंसे लोगों के परिवार दिल्ली आ गए। एक और तीन दिसंबर को प्रदर्शन किया। उन्होंने प्रधानमंत्री कार्यालय, विदेश मंत्रालय और गृह मंत्रालय को लेटर भी लिखा है, ताकि पुतिन की यात्रा के दौरान इस मुद्दे को उठाया जा सके। दैनिक भास्कर ने 3 पीड़ित परिवारों से बात की और समझा कि किस तरह उनके रिश्तेदार रूस पहुंचे और वहां जंग में धकेल दिए गए। पहली कहानी: मनोज सिंह शेखावत मनोज सिंह शेखावत रूस जाने से पहले दिल्ली में टूर एंड ट्रैवल्स के काम से जुड़े थे। जयपुर के एक एजेंट शंकर सिंह ने उन्हें रूस में काम दिलवाने का वादा किया था। उसने मनोज से 4 लाख रुपए लिए थे। 1 दिसंबर को मनोज की पत्नी दिव्या भी दिल्ली में प्रदर्शन के लिए आई थीं। वे बताती हैं कि एजेंट ने मनोज को 80-90 हजार रुपए महीने सैलरी दिलाने का वादा किया था। इसके बाद वे ई-वीजा के जरिए रूस चले गए। पहले 15 दिन एक फैक्ट्री में काम किया। बदले में उन्हें पैसे नहीं दिए गए। अगले 15 दिन दूसरी फैक्ट्री में लगाया गया। वहां भी सैलरी नहीं मिली। दिव्या कहती हैं, ‘मनोज तीन महीने तक अलग-अलग जगह पर काम करते रहे। उन्हें कहीं पैसे नहीं मिले। ई-वीजा भी सिर्फ 20 दिन के लिए था। इसलिए मनोज वहीं फंस गए।' 'सितंबर में एजेंट के एक साथी जीतू बोचालिया ने मनोज से रूसी सेना का एग्रीमेंट साइन करवा लिया। ये एग्रीमेंट रूसी भाषा में था। उन्हें पता नहीं चला कि उसमें क्या लिखा है। उन्हें बोला गया कि हेल्पर या बंकर खुदवाने का काम दिया जाएगा, लेकिन ऐसा कुछ नहीं था।’ दिव्या आगे बताती हैं, ‘जिस दिन से उन्होंने एग्रीमेंट साइन किया, बातचीत बंद हो गई। 15-20 दिन बाद बात हुई, तो पता चला कि उन्हें मॉस्को से 1600 किमी दूर कहीं भेज दिया गया था। 15 दिन बाद फिर बात हुई तो मनोज ने बताया कि बहुत बड़ा धोखा हो गया है।’ दिव्या कहती हैं, ‘मैंने उनसे कहा कि वहां से भाग जाओ। मनोज ने बताया कि रूस के सैनिक सिर पर राइफल तानकर रखते हैं। कहते हैं कि यहीं मारकर दफना देंगे। रूसी सेना किसी को निकलने नहीं देती है। आगे नहीं जाने की बात करने पर मारपीट करते हैं। उनके एक साथी ने आगे जाने के डर से खुद के पैर पर गोली मार ली थी। वो अभी वहीं हॉस्पिटल में है। मनोज के बारे में कुछ पता नहीं है।’ ‘15 अक्टूबर को मेरी उनसे आखिरी बार बात हुई थी। हमने भारतीय दूतावास से संपर्क किया। दो बार प्रदर्शन किया, लेकिन कोई फायदा नहीं हुआ। मनोज को अंदाजा नहीं था कि सिर्फ 15 दिन की ट्रेनिंग देकर उन्हें सीधे वॉर जोन में भेज दिया जाएगा।' 'मैंने उनसे लोकेशन मंगवाई थी। वे यूक्रेन बॉर्डर पर थे। उन्हें 20 किलोमीटर और दूर जाना था। वहां से रूस यूक्रेन पर अटैक करता है। उन्होंने एक ऑडियो मैसेज भेजा था, उसमें गोलियों की आवाज आ रही थी।’ मनोज के परिवार ने 18 नवंबर को जयपुर के करधनी थाने में एजेंट्स के खिलाफ केस दर्ज करवाया है। शिकायत में कहा गया है कि एजेंटों ने गिरोह बना रखा है, जो पैसे लेकर राजस्थान और दूसरे राज्यों के लोगों को विदेश भेजते हैं। परिवार का आरोप है कि शिकायत करने पर एक एजेंट की तरफ से कॉल करके जान से मारने की धमकी दी गई। दूसरी कहानी: सुरेंद्र दहिया मनोज की तरह ही कहानी सुरेंद्र दहिया की भी है। उनके साथ पत्नी के भाई महावीर प्रसाद भी रूस गए थे। दोनों से तीन महीने से बात नहीं हो पाई है। सुरेंद्र खेती करते थे। परिवार के मुताबिक, एक अप्रैल को एजेंट को 3.5 लाख रुपए देकर रूस गए थे। उनसे कहा गया था कि कंस्ट्रक्शन का काम मिलेगा। उन्होंने वहां तीन-चार महीने काम किया। फिर प्रदीप नाम के एक एजेंट ने सुरेंद्र को सेना में भर्ती करा दिया। बताया कि उसे गड्ढे खोदने और बंकर बनाने जैसे छोटे-मोटे काम मिल जाएंगे। सुरेंद्र के ममेरे भाई सुनील दिल्ली में प्रदर्शन करने पहुंचे थे। वे बताते हैं, ‘सुरेंद्र से रूसी भाषा में कॉन्ट्रैक्ट साइन करवाया गया था। वे उसे पढ़ नहीं पाए। वहां सारे भारतीय एजेंट ही फंसा रहे हैं। अगस्त में सुरेंद्र और महावीर को सेना में भर्ती कराया गया था। शुरुआत में उन्हें सेंट्रल रूस के इवानोवो शहर ले गए। बाद में दक्षिण की तरफ यूक्रेन बॉर्डर के करीब रोस्तोव भेजा गया। आखिरी बार उनसे 7 सितंबर को बात हुई थी। उन्होंने बताया था कि हमें फ्रंटलाइन पर भेज रहे हैं। अगर 2-3 दिन तक कॉन्टैक्ट न हो, तो हमें वापस लाने की कोशिश करना।’ सुनील कहते हैं कि पिछले तीन महीने से हम लगातार रूस में भारतीय दूतावास से संपर्क कर रहे हैं। एक ही तरह का जवाब आता है कि हम रूसी अधिकारियों के संपर्क में हैं, जल्द अपडेट देंगे। सारे लोगों को ऐसे ही मैसेज आ रहे हैं। अब तक कोई जानकारी नहीं दी गई है।’ सुनील बताते हैं, ‘हम लोग ईमेल कर-करके थक गए हैं। अभी संसद का सत्र शुरू हुआ है। 4 तारीख को रूस के राष्ट्रपति भारत आ रहे हैं। हमने यही सोचा था कि अगर हम प्रदर्शन करेंगे तो हमारी बात मीडिया में जाएगी। धरने के बाद हम पीएमओ, विदेश मंत्रालय, राष्ट्रपति कार्यालय और गृह मंत्रालय में ज्ञापन देकर आए हैं। हमारे बच्चे वापस आ जाएं, इससे ज्यादा हमारी कोई मांग नहीं है।’ तीसरी कहानी: संदीप कुमार संदीप कुमार सितंबर, 2024 में स्टडी वीजा पर रूस गए थे। एक एजेंट ने 6 लाख रुपए लेकर उन्हें मॉस्को के एक रेस्टोरेंट में काम करने भेजा था। कुछ महीने काम करने के बाद बीमार हो गए और भारत आ गए। तीन महीने यहां रहे, फिर जुलाई में वापस रूस चले गए। एक महीने बाद संदीप को रूस में अंबाला का एक एजेंट मिला। उसी ने संदीप को आर्मी में भर्ती करवा दिया। उन्हें बताया गया कि कुक का काम करना है और अच्छी सैलरी मिलेगी। संदीप के मामा श्री भगवान बताते हैं, ‘संदीप की मां ने उसे रूस भेजने के लिए गहने तक बेच दिए थे। कुछ पैसे कर्ज भी लिए। एग्रीमेंट साइन करवाने के बाद एजेंट ने संदीप के अकाउंट में 10 लाख रुपए भेज दिए, लेकिन ये पैसे वो कभी घर नहीं भेज पाया।’ ‘उसे बताया गया था कि तीन महीने की ट्रेनिंग दी जाएगी, लेकिन सिर्फ 10-12 दिन की ट्रेनिंग के बाद उसे रूस के कब्जे वाले यूक्रेन के इलाकों में भेज दिया गया।' 25 सितंबर को किसी रूसी कमांडर ने उसे फोन दिया था। तब संदीप ने बात की थी। 5 दिन लगातार बात होती रही। वो बता रहा था कि यहां जान का खतरा है। गश्त और वॉर फ्रंट पर सामान पहुंचाने जैसे काम दिए जा रहे हैं। संदीप ने एक अक्टूबर को रूस से एक वीडियो भेजा था। इसमें वो कह रहे हैं, ‘प्लीज मुझे यहां से निकलवाओ। मुझे फंसाया गया है। हमें आगे भेजने के लिए बोल रहे हैं। ढाई किलोमीटर दूर रूसी सेना ने यूक्रेन के एक शहर पर कब्जा किया हुआ है, उधर ही मुझे भेजेंगे। वहां बहुत ज्यादा खतरा है। यहां अभी एक बंकर में रखा हुआ है। मेरी मदद करें।’ भगवान कहते हैं कि 1 अक्टूबर को संदीप की परिवार के साथ आखिरी बार बात हुई थी। दो महीने से कोई संपर्क नहीं है। क्या पता वो जिंदा भी है या नहीं। संदीप ने अपने भाई को बताया था कि घरवालों को संभाल लेना। मेरा पता नहीं, वापस आऊंगा या नहीं। मेरा वॉट्सएप ब्लॉक कर दिया जाएगा। मोबाइल लेकर फ्रंटलाइन पर भेजा जाएगा।’ भगवान कहते हैं कि सोशल मीडिया के जरिए पता चला कि संदीप फंस गया है। उसके बाद से परिवार ने लगातार अधिकारियों से संपर्क किया, लेकिन रिस्पॉन्स नहीं मिला है। सरकार डेड बॉडी वहां से ला सकती है, तो जिंदा लोगों को क्यों नहीं ला सकती है। सांसद ने लोकसभा में बताया- 61 भारतीय फंसे हैं 1 दिसंबर को पीड़ित परिवारों ने राजस्थान के नागौर से लोकसभा सांसद हनुमान बेनीवाल से मदद मांगी थी। 3 दिसंबर को बेनीवाल ने लोकसभा में रूस में फंसे भारतीयों का मुद्दा उठाया था। उन्होंने बताया कि रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध में फ्रंटलाइन पर 61 भारतीय फंसे हैं। काम का झांसा देकर इस तरीके से युद्ध में भेजा जाना गंभीर चिंता का विषय है। रूसी सरकार से बात करके उनकी वापसी सुनिश्चित कराई जाए। इससे पहले 24 जुलाई को विदेश मंत्रालय ने राज्यसभा में बताया था कि रूसी सेना में 127 भारतीय नागरिक थे। भारत और रूस सरकार से बातचीत के बाद इनमें से 98 लोगों को निकाला गया। रूसी सेना में गए 12 लोग लापता हैं। 7 नवंबर को विदेश मंत्रालय के प्रवक्ता रणधीर जायसवाल ने प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में बताया कि रूसी सेना में शामिल 44 भारतीयों की पहचान की गई है। उसी दौरान मंत्रालय ने बताया कि भारत सरकार रूसी अधिकारियों और पीड़ित परिवारों के संपर्क में है। जायसवाल ने कहा था, ‘हमें जानकारी मिली है कि कई भारतीय नागरिकों को रूसी सेना में भर्ती किया गया है। हमने रूसी अधिकारियों के सामने ये मुद्दा उठाया है। हमने जल्द इन भारतीयों को छोड़ने और इस प्रैक्टिस को खत्म करने की मांग की है। भारत सरकार पीड़ित परिवारों को लगातार अपडेट दे रही है। उनकी सुरक्षित वापसी के लिए मॉस्को से लगातार बातचीत कर रही है।’ हमने पीड़ित परिवारों के मुद्दों पर विदेश मंत्रालय और मॉस्को में भारतीय दूतावास को ई-मेल किया है। जवाब मिलने पर हम रिपोर्ट अपडेट करेंगे। रूस-यूक्रेन जंग में अभी क्या चल रहा आने वाली फरवरी में रूस-यूक्रेन जंग को 4 साल पूरे हो जाएंगे। अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प ने जंग रोकने के लिए 28 पॉइंट का प्लान तैयार किया है। इसके मुताबिक यूक्रेन को अपना लगभग 20% हिस्सा रूस को देना होगा। इसमें पूर्वी यूक्रेन का डोनबास का इलाका शामिल है। इसके अलावा यूक्रेन सिर्फ 6 लाख जवानों वाली सेना रख सकेगा। NATO में यूक्रेन की एंट्री नहीं होगी। नाटो सेनाएं यूक्रेन में नहीं रहेंगी। रूस के शांति प्रस्ताव मानते ही उस पर लगे सभी प्रतिबंध हटा दिए जाएंगे। साथ ही यूरोप में जब्त की गई लगभग 2000 करोड़ रुपए की संपत्ति डीफ्रीज होगी। इस जंग में यूरोपीय देश यूक्रेन के साथ हैं। रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन ने 2 दिसंबर को यूरोपीय देशों को चेतावनी दी। उन्होंने कहा कि रूस यूरोप से युद्ध नहीं चाहता, लेकिन अगर यूरोप युद्ध शुरू करता है तो मामला इतना जल्दी खत्म नहीं होगा। बातचीत करने वाला कोई नहीं बचेगा। Copyright © 2024-25 DB Corp ltd., All Rights Reserved This website follows the DNPA Code of

"’मुर्शिदाबाद में बाबरी बनना तय, हिम्मत है तो गिराओ’: कौन हैं मस्जिद का ऐलान करने वाले विधायक हुमायूं, TMC ने सस्पेंड किया3:42","‘6 दिसंबर (2025) को 12 बजे ही बाबरी मस्जिद का शिलान्यास होगा। मुसलमानों का सेंटिमेंट टूटा है, कुछ तो करना पड़ेगा। 1992 में जिन्होंने बाबरी मस्जिद तोड़ी, उनमें हिम्मत है तो मुर्शिदाबाद में आकर गिरा दें।‘ मुर्शिदाबाद के भरतपुर से TMC विधायक हुमायूं कबीर पश्चिम बंगाल में बाबरी नाम से मस्जिद बनाने का दावा कर रहे हैं। हुमायूं कहते हैं कि जिस दिन अयोध्या में बाबरी मस्जिद गिराई गई थी, उसी तारीख पर यानी 6 दिसंबर 2025 को मुर्शिदाबाद के बेलडांगा में वे बाबरी मस्जिद का शिलान्यास करेंगे। हालांकि इस पूरे विवाद के बाद हुमायूं को अब TMC से निलंबित कर दिया गया है। इसके जवाब में BJP और एक हिंदूवादी संगठन ने मुर्शिदाबाद में ही अयोध्या की तर्ज पर दो अलग-अलग राम मंदिर बनाने का दावा किया है। BJP का ये भी कहना है कि कोई भी अपनी जमीन पर मस्जिद बना सकता है, लेकिन बाबर के नाम पर इस देश में मस्जिद नहीं बनेगी। अगर बनी तो अयोध्या जैसा हाल होगा। जिस मुर्शिदाबाद में मस्जिद और मंदिर बनाने के दावे किए जा रहे हैं, वो बांग्लादेश के बॉर्डर वाला संवेदनशील इलाका है। इसी साल अप्रैल में वक्फ कानून के खिलाफ हुए प्रोटेस्ट के दौरान यहां हिंसा भड़की थी, जिसमें 3 लोगों की जान चली गई थी। बंगाल में अप्रैल 2026 में चुनाव भी होने हैं। ऐसे में मुर्शिदाबाद में मंदिर-मस्जिद पर बयानबाजी क्या चुनावी रणनीति का हिस्सा है? हुमायूं कबीर इस ऐलान के जरिए क्या साधने की कोशिश कर रहे? TMC और BJP इसे लेकर क्या सोचती हैं? दैनिक भास्कर ने विधायक हुमायूं कबीर, पॉलिटिकल पार्टियों और सीनियर जर्नलिस्ट से बात कर ये समझने की कोशिश की। सबसे पहले हुमायूं कबीर और उनके दावों की बात… बाबरी मस्जिद बनना तय, किसी को नाम पर एतराज क्यों पूरे विवाद के केंद्र में भरतपुर से TMC विधायक हुमायूं कबीर हैं। वे इससे पहले कांग्रेस और BJP में भी रह चुके हैं। बाबरी मस्जिद बनाने के दावों को लेकर हमने हुमायूं से बात की। वे दावा करते हैं कि जगह पहले से तय है और निर्माण निश्चित रूप से होगा। हुमायूं ने पहले बेलडांगा में मस्जिद के लिए जो जगह देखी थी, उसे जमीन मालिक ने देने से मना कर दिया। अब वे नई जगह तलाश रहे हैं। हुमायूं कहते हैं, ‘सभी जगह देख ली है। जमीन के छह हिस्सेदार हैं। उनमें से चार देने को तैयार हैं, लेकिन दो नहीं। इनमें लोकल TMC विधायक हसनुज्जमां शेख, रबीउल आलम चौधरी और उनके बेटे पुलिस की मदद से जमीन देने से रोकने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं। पहले एक जगह विरोध हुआ तो मैंने वहां मना कर दिया।‘ बाबरी नाम को लेकर विवाद के सवाल पर हुमायूं कहते हैं, ‘नाम पर आपत्ति कैसे है? अगर मेरा बेटा पैदा हो तो मैं उसका क्या नाम रखूं, ये बताने वाली BJP कौन होती है।‘ अपनी ही पार्टी के साथ न देने पर हुमायूं कहते हैं, 'पार्टी का इससे कोई लेना-देना नहीं है। पार्टी का सिद्धांत मानूंगा, लेकिन ये मेरे कौम का मामला है। कौम के लोग मदद कर रहे हैं, पार्टी का बोलना मेरे लिए अहमियत नहीं रखता।' ‘100 मुसलमान शहीद होंगे तो 500 को ले जाएंगे‘ मुर्शिदाबाद में बाबरी मस्जिद बनाने को लेकर मीडिया से बात करते हुए 28 नवंबर 2025 को हुमायूं कबीर ने एक और विवादित बयान दिया। उन्होंने कहा, ‘जो कोई उन्हें रोकने की कोशिश करेगा, उसे गंभीर नतीजे भुगतने होंगे। अगर 100 मुसलमान शहीद होंगे तो वे अपने साथ 500 लोगों को ले जाएंगे।‘ हुमायूं कबीर पहले भी विवादित बयानों को लेकर चर्चा में रहे हैं। 2024 में लोकसभा चुनाव प्रचार अभियान के समय मुर्शिदाबाद के शक्तिपुर में हुमायूं कबीर ने एक जनसभा में कहा, ‘मैं राजनीति छोड़ दूंगा अगर दो घंटे में तुम्हें (हिंदुओं को) भागीरथी नदी में डुबो न दिया। तुम 30% हो, हम 70% (मुस्लिम) हैं। मैं तुम्हें शक्तिपुर में रहने नहीं दूंगा।‘ इस बयान के बाद चुनाव आयोग ने उन्हें नोटिस जारी किया था। वहीं TMC ने इस बयान से दूरी बना ली थी। TMC बोली- उस विधायक का कोई मोल नहीं, SIR पर फोकस TMC पहले ही हुमायूं कबीर के बयान से किनारा कर चुकी है। TMC सांसद कल्याण बनर्जी कहते हैं, ‘हम हुमायूं कबीर के बयानों को तवज्जो नहीं देते। उस विधायक का कोई मोल नहीं है। पश्चिम बंगाल में लोग सिर्फ एक ही व्यक्ति से प्यार करते हैं और उसी पर भरोसा करते हैं। वो ममता बनर्जी हैं। पार्टी उन्हीं के नाम पर चलती है।‘ पार्टी में ममता बनर्जी के भतीजे अभिषेक बनर्जी के करीबी सोर्स ने बताया कि ममता बनर्जी और अभिषेक बनर्जी के संज्ञान में मामला लाया गया है। अभी हुमायूं कबीर के मुद्दे को पार्टी तूल नहीं देना चाहती थी क्योंकि SIR अभी बड़ा मुद्दा है। हालांकि अब TMC ने हुमायूं को पार्टी से निलंबित कर दिया है। 26 दिसंबर को मुर्शिदाबाद में राम मंदिर का शिलान्यास TMC भले ही इस मामले को तवज्जो न दे रही हो, लेकिन BJP इसे लेकर TMC को लगातार घेर रही है। मुर्शिदाबाद में BJP के पूर्व जिलाध्यक्ष शाखारव सरकार ने जिले में ही राम मंदिर बनाने की बात कही है। हमने शाखारव सरकार से बात की। वे कहते हैं कि बाबरी नाम की मस्जिद मंजूर नहीं है। हुमायूं कबीर पर सुप्रीम कोर्ट के आदेश के उल्लंघन का आरोप लगाते हुए शाखारव कहते हैं, ‘भारत में कोई बाबरी मस्जिद नहीं बनाना चाहता है। आप सुप्रीम कोर्ट के आदेश का उल्लंघन कर रहे हैं। बाबर की मस्जिद मुर्शिदाबाद में नहीं बनेगी। इब्राहिम लोधी भारतीय मुस्लिम थे, उनका कत्ल कर दिया गया। मस्जिद बनानी है, तो अबुल कलाम, नजुल इस्लाम, रिजवान करीम या जामा मस्जिद के नाम पर बने।’ शाखारव ने 26 दिसंबर को मुर्शिदाबाद में राम मंदिर का शिलान्यास करने का दावा किया है। आक्रमणकारी के नाम पर मस्जिद बनी तो विरोध होगा पश्चिम बंगाल में BJP के लीडर दिलीप घोष कहते हैं कि कोई भी अपनी जमीन पर मस्जिद बना सकता है, लेकिन बाबर के नाम पर इस देश में मस्जिद नहीं बनेगी। वो आक्रांता था। उसके नाम पर किसी ने भी मस्जिद बनाने की कोशिश की तो देशभर में विरोध होगा। हुमायूं कबीर के बयानों को दिलीप घोष TMC की बैकग्राउंड पॉलिटिक्स बताते हैं। वे कहते हैं, ‘हुमायूं को मिनिस्ट्री चाहिए इसलिए वे इस तरह की बात कर रहे हैं। मुर्शिदाबाद में मुस्लिम आबादी ज्यादा है और कम्युनल चीजें होती रहती हैं। आप उनके पिछले स्टेटमेंट देखिए। वे कहते थे कि हिंदुओं को काटकर गंगा में बहा देंगे। ऐसा बोलकर वो अटेंशन क्रिएट करते हैं। उन्हें पार्टी से बार्गेनिंग करनी है क्योंकि उन्हें मिनिस्ट्री चाहिए।‘ बाबर के नाम वाली मस्जिद का अयोध्या जैसा हाल होगा BJP की हिंदूवादी छवि वाली नेता उमा भारती ने चेतावनी दी कि बाबर के नाम पर बनी इमारत का वही हाल होगा जो अयोध्या में हुआ था। उन्होंने X पर लिखा, ‘खुदा, इबादत, इस्लाम के नाम पर मस्जिद बने हम सम्मान करेंगे। अगर बाबर के नाम से इमारत बनी तो उसका वही हाल होगा, जो 6 दिसंबर को अयोध्या में हुआ था। ईंटें तक नहीं बची थीं।‘ ‘मेरी मित्र ममता बनर्जी जी को सलाह है कि बाबर के नाम पर मस्जिद बनाने की बात कहने वालों पर कार्रवाई करें। पश्चिम बंगाल और देश में अस्मिता और सद्भाव के लिए आपकी भी जिम्मेवारी है।‘ उमा भारती के एक-एक ईंट गायब वाले बयान पर विधायक हुमायूं उन्हें मुर्शिदाबाद आने की चुनौती देते हैं। वे कहते हैं कि उमा भारती को ईंट खोलने के लिए मुर्शिदाबाद आना पड़ेगा। हिम्मत है तो आकर गिरा दें। अगर तोड़ दिया तो दोबारा बनाएंगे, तीसरी बार भी बनाएंगे। हालांकि उमा भारती ने इस बयान पर कोई जवाब नहीं दिया है। मस्जिद को लेकर विवाद साल भर पुराना पूरा विवाद नवंबर 2024 में शुरू हुआ। तब TMC विधायक हुमायूं कबीर ने अयोध्या वाली बाबरी मस्जिद की छोटी प्रतिकृति बनाने की बात कही थी। जब बाबरी नाम के इस्तेमाल को लेकर विवाद खड़ा हो गया, तब उन्होंने कहा था कि बाबरी मस्जिद मुसलमानों के लिए भावनात्मक मुद्दा है। इसके बाद दिसंबर 2024 में ही BJP ने मुर्शिदाबाद में राम मंदिर बनाने की बात कही। हालांकि तब भी BJP नेता शंकर घोष का कहना था कि राम मंदिर को मस्जिद के जवाब के तौर पर नहीं देखा जाना चाहिए। मंदिर संस्कृति का हिस्सा है, जबकि बाबरी मस्जिद का एक खराब इतिहास है, ये बंगाल में कैसे बन सकती है। राम मंदिर बनाने का ऐलान करने वाला ट्रस्ट बोला- हालात बिगाड़ने की कोशिश एक हिंदूवादी संगठन बोंगियो राम सेवक परिषद ट्रस्ट ने भी दिसंबर 2024 में राम मंदिर बनाने की बात कही थी। 22 जनवरी 2025 को अयोध्या में राम मंदिर की प्राण प्रतिष्ठा को साल भर पूरा होने पर सागरदिघी विधानसभा क्षेत्र के अलंकार गांव में मंदिर का शिलान्यास भी हुआ। ट्रस्ट के प्रेसिडेंट अंबिकानंद महाराज दोबारा मस्जिद का मुद्दा उठाने को राजनीति से प्रेरित मानते हैं। वे कहते हैं, ‘ये बयानबाजी हालात बिगाड़ने के लिए हो रही है। सुप्रीम कोर्ट का राम मंदिर पर दिया आदेश सर्वोच्च है। बाबर की दलाली एंटी-नेशनल है। हुमायूं कबीर को एंटी-सोशल घोषित करके लॉकअप में डाल देना चाहिए। मुर्शिदाबाद सेंसिटिव इलाका है, यहां दंगे हो चुके, लेकिन मुस्लिम समुदाय अब कोई टेंशन नहीं चाहता।‘ अंबिकानंद महाराज कहते हैं कि ये फ्लिपल माइंडेड पॉलिटिशियन TMC में खराब स्थिति में है, वो अपनी नई पार्टी शुरू करने की सोच रहा है। इसके बयानों का कोई मूल्य नहीं। बाबरी मस्जिद के साथ भारतीय मुस्लिमों का कोई लेना-देना नहीं है। अब जान लीजिए एक्सपर्ट क्या कह रहे... SIR के मुद्दे पर पिछड़ रही BJP हुमायूं को मुद्दा बनाना चाह रही इस मामले को लेकर हमने सीनियर जर्नलिस्ट प्रभाकर मणि तिवारी से भी बात की। वे मंदिर-मस्जिद के मामले को इलेक्शन से पहले सांप्रदायिक राजनीति की कोशिश मानते हैं। वे कहते हैं कि TMC ने SIR का मुद्दा पकड़ा है, ये BJP पर भारी पड़ रहा है। इसीलिए BJP हुमायूं कबीर के मुद्दे को भुनाना चाहती है। हालांकि प्रभाकर कहते हैं, ‘बंगाल में सांप्रदायिक राजनीति का फायदा नहीं होता। 2021 के विधानसभा और फिर 2024 के लोकसभा चुनावों में कोशिश हुई, लेकिन वोटरों ने ठुकरा दिया।‘ TMC का रुख: कोई इत्तफाक नहीं, वोट बैंक को नुकसान ​​​​​​हुमायूं ​कबीर के बयानों पर TMC की प्रतिक्रिया को लेकर प्रभाकर मानते हैं, ‘पार्टी जानबूझकर इससे दूरी बना रही है। TMC के सीनियर लीडर ये समझ गए हैं कि अंदर-खाने पार्टी इससे इत्तफाक नहीं रखती। इसीलिए इसे अपने हाल पर छोड़ दिया गया है। बंगाल में SIR बड़ा मुद्दा है, ममता सरकार का फोकस उसी पर है।‘ प्रभाकर 6 दिसंबर को मुर्शिदाबाद में माहौल बिगड़ने की आशंका जताते हैं। वे कहते हैं, ‘मुर्शिदाबाद में अप्रैल में CAA संशोधन पर दंगे, हिंसा और पलायन हुआ। BJP ने मुद्दा बनाया, लेकिन हफ्ते भर में शांत हो गया। अब BJP मस्जिद को चुनावी मुद्दा बना सकती है।‘ ‘हालांकि ममता BJP की रणनीति जानती हैं, इसलिए पार्टी-सरकार स्तर पर ही इस मसले को रोकने की कोशिश करेंगी। वे हुमायूं कबीर को आखिरी मौके पर रोक सकती हैं। पहले भी हुमायूं कबीर अपनी पार्टी बनाना चाहते थे, लेकिन तब अभिषेक बनर्जी के साथ बैठक के बाद पीछे हट गए।‘ ....................... ये खबर भी पढ़ें.... 11 बार विधायक-सांसद रहे आजम खान अब कैदी नंबर 425 17 नवंबर 2025, दोपहर का वक्त, पुलिसवाले यूपी के पूर्व मंत्री आजम खान और उनके बेटे अब्दुल्ला को रामपुर के MP-MLA कोर्ट से जिला जेल ले जा रहे थे। पुलिस की गाड़ी से उतरकर आजम जेल के मेन गेट पर उतरे, तो मीडिया ने घेर लिया। हाथ में चश्मे का केस और बिस्किट के 2 पैकेट थे। पीछे बेटे अब्दुल्ला भी गाड़ी से उतरे। आजम से पूछा गया- फर्जी पैन कार्ड मामले में आपको 7 साल की सजा हुई है, क्या कहना चाहते हैं? जवाब में आजम ने क्या कहा? पढ़िए पूरी खबर...

"एनकाउंटर-250 मर्डर करने वाला वेस्टर्न यूपी का 'फौजी': बहन का दुपट्टा खींचने वालों को वहीं ठोका, पहले चेयरमैन फिर विधायक की जान ली3:57","मई, 1994 की दोपहर। बुलंदशहर गर्मी नहीं, लगातार बढ़ते अपराधों से पिघल रहा था। जहांगीरपुर के जंगल में उस दिन हलचल थी। घने पेड़ों की ओट में भारी हथियारों से लैस पुलिसवालों की सांसें थमी हुई थीं। सभी की नजरें एक कच्ची सड़क पर टिकी थीं। उड़ती धूल का हर कण किसी जाने-पहचाने नाम की आहट दे रहा था। खबर थी कि वो आज इसी रास्ते से आएगा जिसे खौफ की परछाईं कहा जाता था, महेंद्र फौजी। जो दशकों तक पुलिस के लिए चुनौती बना रहा। आज ये जंगल उसका आखिरी इम्तिहान लेने वाला था। एनकाउंटर के दूसरे एपिसोड में आज कहानी वेस्ट यूपी के ऐसे दुर्दांत अपराधी की जो मिलिट्री से रिटायर्ड था। फिर कैसे उसने 50 से ज्यादा मर्डर, लूट और किडनैपिंग के मामलों को अंजाम दिया। गैंगवार में न जाने कितनों की जाने गईं और आखिर में पुलिस मुठभेड़ में मारा गया, लेकिन कैसे… किस्सा 1: मुझे ‘ना’ सुनना पसंद नहीं 80 का दशक। दिल्ली में तेजी से डेवलपमेंट हो रहा था। इसका असर ये हुआ कि दिल्ली से सटे पश्चिमी उत्तर प्रदेश के जिलों में जमीनों की कीमतें बढ़ रही थीं। ये वो दौर था जब गांव का गुंडा, नेता और दलाल सब एक ही धंधे में लगे थे। जमीन हड़पो, बेचो और पैसा कमाओ। इसी दौर में उपजा एक अपराधी था, महेंद्र सिंह गुर्जर। बेहद सनकी, जरा-जरा सी बात पर मरने-मारने पर उतर आता। आर्मी से रिटायर्ड था, इसलिए लोग ‘महेंद्र फौजी’ कहते थे। साल 1982 में जुलाई की एक दोपहर। महेंद्र आंगन में कुर्सी पर बैठा अखबार पढ़ रहा था। तभी उसकी बहन महेंद्री आती दिखी। फौजी ने मुस्कुराकर कहा- ""अरे महेंद्री, तू अचानक आ गई। खबर भी नहीं की।"" भाई को देखते ही महेंद्री अचानक दोनों हाथों से मुंह छुपाकर रोने लगी। फौजी का चेहरा सख्त हो गया। “अरे क्या हुआ? कुछ बोल।” महेंद्री सिर झुकाए जोर-जोर से रोती जा रही थी। फौजी का गुस्सा सातवें आसमान पर था। उसने डांटते हुए पूछा- ""अरे मुंह खोलेगी?"" महेंद्री ने सिसकते हुए कहा- ""मुंह खोलने लायक ही नहीं रही।"" फौजी का गुस्सा तुरंत कम हो गया। उसने बहन को हाथ पकड़कर बैठाया और धीरज बंधाते हुए बोला- ""बोल क्या बात है। किसी ने कुछ कह दिया तुझसे?"" महेंद्री नीचे देखती हुई, टूटी आवाज में बोली- ""ससुराल से आ रही थी, गांव के बाहर दो लड़के मिले। उन्होंने मेरा दुपट्टा खींचा।"" फौजी- ""किस @#$% की हिम्मत हुई? पूरी बात बता।"" महेंद्री- ""दोनों लड़के पहले मजाक में बोले कि छू लूं। मैंने मना किया तो बोले 'लड़की जात होकर मना करेगी। ना सुनना हमें पसंद नहीं।' फिर दुपट्टा खींचा और हाथ पकड़कर जबरदस्ती करने लगे।"" फौजी- ""तेरे आदमी को पता है ये बात।"" महेंद्री- ""पहले उसे ही बताई। वो बोला छंटे हुए बदमाश हैं बात बढ़ाने से बिगड़ेगी। इसे यहीं दबा दे।"" इसके बाद महेंद्र ने कुछ नहीं पूछा। बहन को घर के भीतर ले गया। लड़कों का पता पूछा और अपने दोस्त सतबीर गुर्जर के घर चल दिया। सतबीर को आवाज दी तो वो मुंह में बीड़ी दबाए बाहर आया। “क्या हुआ फौजी? भरी दोपहर में आराम कर लेता।” महेंद्र- ""चल, किलागढ़ पुट्ठी। जरूरी काम है।"" सतबीर हंसकर बोला- ""किसकी जमीन देख ली?"" महेंद्र ने आंखें तरेरकर कहा- ""इस बार जमीन नहीं जान लेनी है।"" सतबीर ने कोई रिएक्शन नहीं दिया। दूसरी बीड़ी सुलगाई, भीतर गया, एक पिस्टल उठाई और बिना कोई सवाल किए महेंद्र के साथ निकल पड़ा। दोनों सीधे उन लड़कों में से एक के घर पहुंचे। दोनों बाहर खटिया पर बैठे ठहाके लगा रहे थे लेकिन जैसे ही फौजी को देखा उनकी हंसी गायब हो गई। वे फौजी को जानते नहीं थे, लेकिन बंदूक देखकर कुछ सकपका गए। फौजी ने बिना कुछ कहे एक के बाल पकड़े और मुंह पर घूंसा मारा। उसकी नाक टूट गई, खून बहने लगा। दूसरे को सतबीर ने लात मारकर गिरा दिया। दोनों चीखने लगे। गांव के लोग दूर खड़े थे, पर किसी की बीच में आने की हिम्मत नहीं हुई। तभी एक लड़के की मां घर से बाहर आई और उन्हें छोड़ने की मिन्नतें करने लगी। लेकिन फौजी और सतबीर ने दस मिनट तक इतने लात-घूंसे बरसाए कि दोनों लड़के अधमरे हो गए। फौजी ने औंधे पड़े एक लड़के का चेहरा ऊपर करके पूछा- ""मेरी बहन को क्यों छुआ?"" लड़के गिड़गिड़ाने लगे- ""गलती हो गई, छोड़ दो भाईसाब छोड़ दो।"" फौजी बोला- ""थूक के चाट।"" दोनों ने जमीन पर थूका और फिर चाटने लगे। फौजी ने उन्हें झटका देकर छोड़ा और कमर से रिवॉल्वर निकाल ली। उनकी तरफ तानकर बोला- ""मार दूं गोली, बोल साले गोली मार दूं?"" दोनों गिड़गिड़ाने लगे- ""नहीं भाईसाब, मत मारो… गलती हो गई हमसे।"" फौजी के चेहरे पर शैतानी मुस्कान आ गई। बोला- ""मुझे भी ना सुनना पसंद नहीं।"" ठां…ठां… दोनों के सीने में दो-दो गोलियां उतार दीं। बंदूक की आवाज सुनकर आसपास के लोग घरों में भाग गए। लड़के की मां वहीं बैठकर छाती पीटने लगी। फौजी के सिर पर खून सवार था। चीखकर बोला- ""ये देख तेरा खून, कितना गंदा खून है।"" इतना कहते ही उसने औरत को भी गोली मार दी। तीन जिंदगियां खत्म करने के बाद भी फौजी के चेहरे पर शिकन नहीं थी। पुलिस में रपट दर्ज हुई और फौजी फरार हो गया। लड़कों की मौत ही उसके लिए इंसाफ था। खून-खराबे की दुनिया में महेंद्र फौजी का ये पहला कदम था। किस्सा 2: अब पता चला मैं कौन हूं? यूपी-दिल्ली बॉर्डर के पास ‘लोनी’ में वो हत्याकांड हुआ जिसने महेंद्र फौजी का नाम पूरे वेस्ट यूपी में आग की तरह फैला दिया। लोनी नगर पंचायत अध्यक्ष और रियल एस्टेट कारोबारी था जगमाल सिंह। इसी की छत्रछाया में फौजी ने अपराध का साम्राज्य खड़ा किया था। जगमाल तय करता था कि कौन सी जमीन कब्जानी है और फौजी उस काम को पूरा कर देता। एक दिन फौजी जगमाल के बंगले पर पहुंचा। वो कुछ लोगों से मीटिंग कर रहा था। फौजी ने दरवाजे पर खड़े होकर ही आवाज लगाई- ""चेयरमैन साब, ओ चेयरमैन साब…।"" जगमाल ने नजर उठाई और फिर बातों में लग गया। फौजी ने कुछ देर इंतजार किया और फिर बोला- ""साब, दो मिनट चाहिए, जरूरी बात है।"" इतना सुनते ही जगमाल आग बबूला हो उठा, चिल्लाया- ""पैसे चाहिए न तुझे? मा@#$%%द, एक रुपया नहीं दूंगा। क्या कर लेगा?"" फिर वहां बैठे लोगों की तरफ देखकर बोला- ""प्रॉपर्टी लाइन में इसको मैं ही लेकर आया। आज ये मेरा बाप बनने चला है। दरवाजे पर खड़े होकर मुझसे हिसाब मांग रहा है।"" फिर फौजी की तरफ घूरकर चिल्लाया- ""मैं कौन हूं, अभी पता नहीं है तुझे। जो कुछ भी है तेरे पास, सब मेरा है। एक रात में पूरा घर खाली करवा लूंगा। भाग यहां से…।"" फौजी चुपचाप जहर के घूंट पीता रहा। उसकी आंखें लाल हो चुकी थीं। वो लगातार जगमाल को घूर रहा था। फिर अचानक पांव पटकता हुआ वहां से चला गया। कुछ दिन बाद, फौजी घर पर नहीं था। आधी रात को कुछ लोग उसके घर में घुसे और सब-कुछ लूट ले गए। फौजी लौटा तो घर खाली। पाप की कमाई रात के काले साए की भेंट चढ़ चुकी थी। फौजी के दिमाग में जगमाल की बात गूंजने लगी। उसने धमकी दी थी कि एक रात में पूरा घर खाली करवा लेगा। फौजी को यकीन था कि ये जगमाल का ही काम है। वो फौरन अपने कुछ खास साथियों के पास पहुंचा और बोला- ""कल जगमाल को मारना है। आज उसकी आखिरी रात है।"" सभी साथी हक्का-बक्का हो गए, बोले- ""पागल हो गए हो? जगमाल को मारोगे? समस्या हो जाएगी फौजी, उसको मारना आसान नहीं है।"" फौजी की आंखें आग उगल रही थीं। उसने सारी बातें अनसुनी कर दीं और बोला- ""अभी से समझ लो कि वो मर चुका है। कल सुबह उसकी लाश दिखेगी।"" अगली सुबह फौजी अपने गिरोह के साथ जगमाल के बंगले के बाहर पहुंच गया। जैसे ही जगमाल की गाड़ी गेट से बाहर निकली, फौजी ने पीछा शुरू कर दिया। शहर से बाहर सुनसान इलाका आते ही अचानक गोलियों की बौछार शुरू हो गई। फौजी और उसके साथी गाड़ी से कूदे और ताबड़तोड़ फायरिंग करने लगे। खिड़कियों के शीशे चूर-चूर होकर सड़क पर बिखर गए। फायरिंग रुकी, फौजी धीरे-धीरे आगे बढ़ा और कार के भीतर झांका। जगमाल का सिर एक तरफ लटक रहा था। शरीर में आखिरी सांस भी बाकी नहीं थी। फौजी देर तक घूरता रहा फिर बोला- ""अब पता चला, मैं कौन हूं?"" किस्सा 3: क्रॉसिंग पर MLA का मर्डर उत्तर प्रदेश अपराध की आग में जल रहा था। इस आग ने 13 सितंबर, 1992 की शाम दादरी से तीन बार के विधायक महेंद्र सिंह भाटी को भस्म कर दिया। शाम करीब 6:30 बजे भाटी अपने घर में बने ऑफिस में कुछ कागजात देख रहे थे। अचानक टेलीफोन की घंटी बजी। दूसरी तरफ से इंस्पेक्टर की आवाज आई। ""महेंद्र भाई, आप कहां हैं? फौरन भंगेल पहुंचिए। बहुत जरूरी बात है।"" भाटी- ""क्या हुआ इंस्पेक्टर साब? सब ठीक है?"" इंस्पेक्टर- ""फोन पर नहीं बता सकता। बस जल्दी आइए।"" भाटी ने अपने ड्राइवर देवेंद्र और गनर कौशिक को चलने का इशारा किया। भाटी के दोस्त उदय सिंह का घर भी पास ही था। उधर से निकलते हुए भाटी की नजर पड़ी कि उदय सिंह बालकनी में खड़े हैं। भाटी ने गाड़ी रुकवाई और बाहर देखकर बोले- ""उदय, नीचे आ जल्दी।"" उदय नीचे आया, पूछा- ""क्या हुआ भाईसाब? इतनी जल्दबाजी में कहां जा रहे हो?"" भाटी ने कहा- ""चुपचाप बैठ कार में। बाद में बताऊंगा।"" कार में बैठते ही उदय ने फिर पूछा- ""कहां चलना है भाईजी?"" ""भंगेल, पुलिस का बुलावा है।"" उदय ने ठहाका लगाया- ""पुलिस का बुलावा और तू मुझे साथ ले जा रहा है? मेरी शामत तो नहीं आई?"" भाटी मुस्कुरा दिए पर बोले कुछ नहीं। कार भंगेल रोड पर दौड़ने लगी। रेलवे क्रॉसिंग नजदीक आई। फाटक बंद था। भाटी ने चिढ़कर कहा- ""इसे भी अभी बंद होना था।"" उदय ने हंसते हुए कहा- ""अरे भाई, दो मिनट की बात है। नेताओं में सब्र क्यों नहीं होता।"" पांच मिनट बाद ट्रेन गुजरी। बैरियर ऊपर हुआ। देवेंद्र ने गाड़ी आगे बढ़ाई। दूसरी तरफ दो गाड़ियां खड़ी दिखीं। दरवाजे पहले से खुले थे। भाटी की नजर उन पर गई तो उनका दिल जोर से धड़का। उन्होंने हड़बड़ाते हुए ड्राइवर से कहा- ""देवेंद्र रुक, कुछ गड़बड़ है।"" लेकिन देवेंद्र को ब्रेक दबाने का वक्त ही नहीं मिला। दोनों गाड़ियों से एक साथ छह लोग उतरे। सभी के चेहरे पर रूमाल बंधा था। एक के हाथ में AK-47 और बाकियों के हाथ में रिवॉल्वर। शुरुआती फायरिंग में कार की विंडशील्ड चूर-चूर हो गई। दूसरी बार में गोलियां भाटी और उदय के पास से गुजर गईं। गनर कौशिक चिल्लाया- ""झुक जाओ साब...।"" MLA भाटी दरवाजा खोलकर बाहर निकलने की कोशिश कर रहे थे। अचानक एक गोली उनकी पीठ में लगी, दूसरी गर्दन में। वो सीट पर ही ढेर हो गए। उदय ने भाटी को सहारा देने की कोशिश की, तभी तीन गोलियों उनकी पीठ में आ धंसीं। सिर्फ दो मिनट में दो लोगों की मौत हो गई। विधायक महेंद्र सिंह भाटी का शरीर छलनी हो चुका था। पुलिस पहुंची तो कार में भाटी और उदय की लाशें थीं। केस दर्ज हुआ, राजनीतिक अदावत के चलते आरोप लगा बुलंदशहर के विधायक डीपी यादव पर। लोनी चेयरमैन जगमाल को मारने के बाद महेंद्र फौजी, डीपी यादव की शरण में आ गया था। डीपी यादव के कहने पर ही फौजी ने भाटी का मर्डर किया था। इससे पहले महेंद्र भाटी के भाई राजवीर की हत्या का आरोप भी महेंद्र फौजी पर लगा था। महेंद्र भाटी उस समय गुर्जरों के बड़े नेता थे। उन्होंने यूपी विधानसभा में अपनी सुरक्षा बढ़ाने के लिए गुहार लगाई थी लेकिन कल्याण सिंह सरकार ने इसे गंभीरता से नहीं लिया। भाटी की हत्या से पूरे यूपी में कोहराम मच गया। अखबारों ने प्रदेश सरकार की बखिया उधेड़कर रख दी। सरकार और पुलिस पर जबरदस्त प्रेशर था। कई जगह छापेमारी हुई। कुछ लोग पकड़े गए लेकिन फौजी का कहीं पता नहीं चला। अब चलते हैं जहां से कहानी शुरू हुई थी… विधायक महेंद्र सिंह भाटी के मर्डर के बाद फौजी ऐसे गायब हुआ, जैसे धुंआ हवा में घुल जाता है। दो साल तक उसका कोई सुराग नहीं मिला। जब उसे लगा कि मामला ठंडा हो चुका है, तो फिर से बुलंदशहर में दाखिल होने की राह खोजने लगा। लेकिन किस्मत शायद उसके खिलाफ नई कहानी लिख चुकी थी। मई 1994, पुलिस को पक्की खबर मिली कि फौजी, जहांगीरपुर के जंगलों से होकर शहर में घुसने वाला है। नमी और पेड़ों की परछाइयों के बीच पुलिसवाले पोजीशन ले चुके थे। जंगल का सन्नाटा भी मानो हथियार बनकर तना खड़ा था। प्लानिंग मुकम्मल थी। दारोगा अचल सिंह यादव झाड़ी की ओट में ट्रिगर पर उंगलियां जमाए बैठे थे। तभी दूर कहीं से इंजन की घरघराहट सुनाई दी। आवाज धीरे-धीरे पास आती गई और फिर सफेद एम्बेसडर कार पुलिया की ओर मुड़ती दिखी। अचल सिंह की आंखें चमक उठीं। उन्होंने फुसफुसाकर कहा- ""यही है, सफेद गाड़ी उसी की है।"" फिर पास में पोजीशन लिए सिपाही से पूछा- ""सड़क पर कांटे डाले हैं ना?"" सिपाही ने जैसे कुछ सुना ही नहीं। जवाब न मिलने पर अचल सिंह ने झुंझलाकर पूछा- ""बोलता क्यों नहीं बे…।"" सिपाही आंखें चुराते हुए बोला- ""साब… वो… भूल गया।"" अचल सिंह का चेहरा अंगारे जैसा लाल हो गया। सालों की मेहनत, महीनों की प्लानिंग के बाद महेंद्र फौजी हाथ आने वाला था, लेकिन एक गलती की वजह से सब चौपट होता दिख रहा था। दिमाग में सवाल चलने लगे- गाड़ी कैसे रुकेगी… गोली चलानी ही पड़ेगी क्या? मगर, फौजी को जिंदा पकड़ना था। कुछ पल सोचने के बाद अचल सिंह बोले- ""दो सिपाही नीचे उतरो। गाड़ी पुलिया पर आते ही पहिए पर गोली मारना। उसे जिंदा पकड़ना है।"" दो सिपाही पेड़ों की ओट लिए नीचे उतरे। सफेद एम्बेसडर सामने से गुजर रही थी। दोनों सिपाहियों ने निशाना साधा। धांय… धांय… लेकिन चूक गए। ये उनकी आखिरी गलती थी। गाड़ी में बैठे फौजी ने बिना एक पल गंवाए AK-47 चला दी। ठां-ठां-ठां-ठां… गोलियां सिपाहियों का सीना चीरती हुई निकल गईं। ये देखकर ऊपर छिपे सिपाही सकते में आ गए। सभी की धड़कनें तेज हो गई, उंगलियां ट्रिगर पर और कस गईं। दारोगा अचल सिंह ने इशारा किया। ऊपर से ताबड़तोड़ गोलियां चलने लगीं। एक सिपाही ने तुरंत थाने में वायरलेस किया। “और फोर्स भेजिए... जहांगीरपुर पुलिया पर दो सिपाही शहीद हो गए हैं। बदमाश के पास AK-47 है। तुरंत भेजिए तुरंत...” पुलिसवाले नीचे की ओर दौड़े। उधर से गोलियों की बरसात हो रही थी। इधर से चार गोलियां चलतीं, उधर से दस गोलियां आतीं। पूरा जंगल बारूद की गंध से भर गया। फिर अचानक दूसरी ओर से फायरिंग रुक गई। एक पल के लिए सन्नाटा छा गया। किसी को कुछ समझ नहीं आया। पुलिसवाले राइफलें तानकर धीरे-धीरे आगे बढ़े। ड्राइवर की सीट के पास एक शरीर औंधा पड़ा था। एक गोली उसकी टांग की हड्डी तोड़कर निकल गई थी। मांस के चीथड़े उड़ गए थे। दूसरी गोली पीठ में धंसी हुई थी। जख्म से खून अभी भी रिस रहा था। अचल सिंह ने हिम्मत जुटाई और आगे बढ़े। शरीर में कोई हरकत नहीं थी। गेहुंआ रंग का चेहरा, पतली सी मूंछ और बदन पर नेताओं जैसा कुर्ता। दारोगा ने सिपाहियों को हुक्म दिया- ""दो गोली और मारो।"" धायं, धायं… शरीर ने कोई हलचल नहीं हुई। मतलब साफ था, महेंद्र फौजी का खौफ अब खत्म हो चुका था। ------ स्टोरी एडिट- कृष्ण गोपाल *** रेफरेंस जर्नलिस्ट- शादाब रिजवी, संजय सार्थक | श्योपाल सिंह (मृतक उदय सिंह के रिश्तेदार) भास्कर टीम ने पुलिस, पीड़ितों और जानकारों से बात करने के बाद सभी कड़ियों को जोड़कर ये स्टोरी लिखी है। फिर भी घटनाओं के क्रम में कुछ अंतर हो सकता है। कहानी को रोचक बनाने के लिए क्रिएटिव लिबर्टी ली गई है। ---------------------------------------------- 'एनकाउंटर' की ये स्टोरी भी पढ़ें... लखनऊ में बाहुबली को बीच सड़क 126 गोलियां मारीं, जान बचाने के लिए पुलिसवालों को जनेऊ की दुहाई दे रहा था श्रीप्रकाश लखनऊ के पॉश इलाकों में से एक इंदिरानगर। शांत और साफ-सुथरी सड़कें। स्प्रिंगडेल स्कूल के आसपास काफी चहल-पहल थी। तभी ठांय… ठांय… ठां…ठां…ठां… अचानक कान फोड़ देने वाली आवाज आने लगी। लगा जैसे किसी ने पटाखे की लड़ी चला दी हो, लेकिन आवाज पटाखों की नहीं, गोलियों की थी। पूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें...

"BJP विधायक बोले- बहुत लेडीज कुत्ते के साथ सोती हैं: रेणुका चौधरी संसद में डॉग साथ ले गई थीं, इस पर शर्मनाक बयान दिया1:11","बिहार के मोतिहारी से बीजेपी विधायक प्रमोद कुमार का महिलाओं पर शर्मनाक बयान सामने आया है। दिल्ली में सांसद रेणुका चौधरी के कुत्ते को लेकर पहुंचने पर उनसे बुधवार को पटना में विधानसभा के बाहर सवाल किया गया तो उन्होंने कहा कि बहुत सारी लेडीज हैं, जो संतु भास्कर ने भी विधायक से उनके बयान पर बात करने के लिए उन्हें फोन किया, लेकिन उन्होंने फोन नहीं उठाया। इधर, इस बयान के बाद राजद ने बीजेपी पर निशाना साधा है। राजद प्रवक्ता प्रियंका भारती ने वीडियो शेयर करते हुए लिखा, क्या मोदी जी को संतुष्टि तब मिलती है, जब उनके पाले हुए नेता महिलाओं के बारे में अभद्र टिप्पणी करते हैं। ऐसे बयान शर्मनाक हैं। सोशल मीडिया पर भी यूजर्स बयान को लेकर कमेंट्स कर रहे हैं। लोगों ने विधायक पर कार्रवाई की मांग की है। साथ ही कहा है कि नेताओं को सोच-समझकर बयान देने चाहिए। खबर में आगे बढ़ने से पहले पोल में हिस्सा लेकर राय दीजिए... 1 दिसंबर को कुत्ते के साथ पहुंची थीं रेणुका चौधरी संसद के शीतकालीन सत्र के पहले दिन यानी 1 दिसबंर को कांग्रेस सांसद रेणुका चौधरी एक कुत्ता लेकर संसद परिसर में पहुंच गईं। इस घटना पर बीजेपी सांसदों ने कड़ा विरोध जताया था। रेणुका चौधरी से जब पूछा गया कि वे कुत्ते को संसद क्यों लाई हैं, तो उन्होंने कहा- सरकार को जानवर पसंद नहीं हैं। इसमें क्या हर्ज है? उन्होंने कहा, ये छोटा और बिल्कुल नुकसान न पहुंचाने वाला जानवर है। काटने वाले और डसने वाले संसद में, कुत्ते नहीं। उनके इस कदम पर बीजेपी सांसद जगदंबिका पाल ने नाराजगी जताई और कहा- रेणुका चौधरी कुत्ता लेकर संसद आईं, यह गलत है। उन पर कार्रवाई होनी चाहिए। विशेषाधिकार का मतलब दुरुपयोग नहीं होता। संसद परिसर में कुत्ते की 2 तस्वीरें... बीजेपी विधायक के बयान पर पॉलिटिकल रिएक्शन पढ़िए कांग्रेस सांसद बोलीं- कौन सी सिक्योरिटी कंसर्न संसद की सिक्योरिटी कंसर्न को लेकर कांग्रेस सांसद ने कहा, 'कौन सा प्रोटोकॉल। कहीं कोई कानून बना है क्या। मैं रास्ते में आ रही थी। वहां स्कूटर और कार वाले का टक्कर हुआ। उसके आगे ये छोटा पिल्ला निकलकर सामने आ गया। ये चारों तरफ सड़क पर घूम रहा था। मैंने सोचा ये पहिए के नीचे आ जाएगा, तो मैंने उठाकर गाड़ी में रख लिया और संसद आ गई और वापस भिजवा दिया।' उन्होंने कहा कि गाड़ी भी गई और कुत्ता भी, तो किस बात की चर्चा चल रही है। असली डसने वाले और काटने वाले तो संसद में बैठे हैं। वे सरकार चलाते हैं। उसका कोई एतराज नहीं। हम किसी गूंगे जानवर की देखभाल करते हैं। वह चर्चा बन गई और कुछ नहीं है कि सरकार के पास। संसद के नियमों का उल्लंघन संसद में पालतू जानवर लाने को नियमों का उल्लंघन माना जाता है। संसद के कानून के मुताबिक ये संसद भवन परिसर व्यवहार एवं आचरण नियम और लोकसभा हैंडबुक फॉर मेंबर्स के तहत गलत है। 1. संसद भवन परिसर व्यवहार एवं आचरण नियम इन नियमों के अनुसार संसद भवन परिसर में केवल अधिकृत व्यक्ति, वाहन और सुरक्षा-क्लियरेंस प्राप्त सामग्री ही ले जाई जा सकती है। पालतू जानवरों को परिसर में प्रवेश की अनुमति नहीं है। यह नियम संसद की सुरक्षा ब्रांच लागू करती है। 2. लोकसभा हैंडबुक फॉर मेंबर्स इस हैंडबुक में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि सदन या संसद भवन में कोई भी ऐसी वस्तु, जीव या सामग्री नहीं लाई जा सकती जो सुरक्षा या मर्यादा को प्रभावित करे। पालतू जानवर इस श्रेणी में आते हैं, इसलिए अनुमति नहीं है। रेणुका तेलंगाना से राज्यसभा सांसद हैं रेणुका चौधरी राज्यसभा सांसद हैं और 2024 में तेलंगाना से दोबारा ऊपरी सदन में चुनी गईं। वे लंबे समय से कांग्रेस की वरिष्ठ नेता हैं और कई महत्वपूर्ण मंत्रालयों में काम कर चुकी हैं। उन्होंने महिला एवं बाल विकास और पर्यटन मंत्रालय में स्वतंत्र प्रभार मंत्री के रूप में सेवा दी। इससे पहले वे स्वास्थ्य एवं परिवार कल्याण राज्य मंत्री भी रहीं। 1984 में तेलुगु देशम पार्टी से राजनीति शुरू की और बाद में 1998 में कांग्रेस में शामिल हो गईं। वे दो बार लोकसभा सांसद रहीं और कई संसदीय समितियों की सदस्य भी रहीं। Copyright © 2024-25 DB Corp ltd., All Rights Reserved This website follows the DNPA Code of Ethics.",real,https://www.bhaskar.com,https://www.bhaskar.com/local/bihar/news/shameful-statement-by-motihari-bjp-mla-136581649.html
"भास्कर इंटरव्यूभारत-पाकिस्तान एशिया कप फाइनल के अंपायर का इंटरव्यू: कहा- 'बल्ले-गेंद से बात करो' यह कहकर अभिषेक-रउफ विवाद संभाला, भारत-पाक मैचों में ज्यादा दबाव3:05","'भारत-पाकिस्तान के मैचों पर ज्यादा दबाव रहता है। लेकिन, IND-PAK जैसे हाई-प्रोफाइल मैचों में बार-बार अंपायरिंग करना किसी भी अंपायर के लिए गर्व की बात है।' यह कहना है एशिया कप फाइनल में अंपायरिंग करने वाले अहमद शाह पकतीन का। अफगानिस्तान के इंटरनेशनल अंपायर ने दैनिक भास्कर से अभिषेक-रउफ की बहस, ट्रॉफी विवाद और अपने सफर पर बात की। अहमद शाह ने बताया कि कैसे बचपन के टेनिस-बॉल मैचों से शुरू हुआ उनका सफर आज बड़े सीरीज और टूर्नामेंट तक पहुंचा है। सवाल-जवाब में अहमद शाह का पूरा इंटरव्यू सवाल: आप रिफ्यूजी कैम्प में कब और क्यों गए? अहमद शाह: रूस के अफगानिस्तान पर हमले के बाद हम 1982 में रिफ्यूजी कैम्प गए। तब मैं 5–6 साल का था। सवाल: वहां क्रिकेट से आपका परिचय कैसे हुआ? अहमद शाह: पहले हम पेशावर में रहते थे। वहीं मैंने क्रिकेट खेलना शुरू किया। TV पर देखकर इस खेल में दिलचस्पी बढ़ी। मैं दूसरी क्लास में था। मुझे याद है, शुरू में मैं अपने कजिन के साथ फुटबॉल खेलने जाता था, लेकिन आसपास लोग बहुत क्रिकेट खेलते थे, तो मैंने भी फुटबॉल छोड़कर क्रिकेट खेलना शुरू कर दिया। सवाल: जब क्रिकेट खेलते थे, तो सोचा था कि आगे जाकर अंपायर बनेंगे? अहमद शाह: उस समय अफगानिस्तान में क्रिकेट का स्ट्रक्चर नहीं था। 2001 के बाद जब क्रिकेट शुरू हुआ, तब उम्र देखते हुए लगा कि खिलाड़ी बनना मुश्किल होगा। इसलिए ग्राउंड से जुड़े रहने के लिए अंपायरिंग चुनी और टारगेट रखा कि पहला अफगान इंटरनेशनल अंपायर बनूंगा और वही हुआ। सवाल: शुरुआत में ही आपको बड़े मैच कैसे मिले? अहमद शाह: मेहनत, लगन और लगातार सीखने की वजह से मिले। टेस्ट, वनडे, टी-20 और लीग सब में काम मिला। यह मेरे लिए गर्व की बात है कि अफगान अंपायरिंग ने बड़ा नाम कमाया। सवाल: बचपन में भी अंपायर रहते थे, ऐसा सुना है? अहमद शाह: हां, जब मोहल्ले में टेनिस-बॉल मैच होते थे, तो मैं ही अंपायर बनता था। अगर बैटिंग करता था तो कोई और खड़ा होता था, वरना पूरा मैच मैं ही कराता था। सवाल: इंटरनेशनल लेवल के लिए आपने इंग्लिश कैसे सीखी? अहमद शाह: स्कूल में पढ़ी थी, लेकिन 2000 के बाद खास तौर पर इंग्लिश कोर्स किए क्योंकि अंपायर के लिए सारी कम्युनिकेशन और नियम इंग्लिश में ही होते हैं। सवाल: आपका इंटरनेशनल डेब्यू भारत में हुआ था। नोएडा का अनुभव कैसा रहा? अहमद शाह: वनडे डेब्यू ग्रेटर नोएडा में हुआ। नोएडा मुझे बहुत पसंद है, शांत, साफ और आरामदायक जगह है। सवाल: एशिया कप में भारत-पाकिस्तान मैच के दौरान जब अभिषेक-रउफ में तनातनी हुई थी, तब आपने हालात कैसे संभाले? अहमद शाह: मैच का माहौल गर्म था, लेकिन हम तैयार थे। मैंने दोनों टीमों से कहा, “बल्ले और गेंद से बात करो, मुंह से नहीं।” कुछ पाकिस्तानी खिलाड़ी पश्तो जानते थे, इसलिए बातचीत आसान रही। सवाल: भारत-पाकिस्तान फाइनल में अंपायरिंग का दबाव कितना था? अहमद शाह: हर मैच में दबाव होता है, लेकिन इसमें ज्यादा था। हमने मानसिक रूप से खुद को बहुत तैयार किया। पूरे मैच में 100% फोकस रखा। अल्लाह का शुक्र है कि मैच बिना किसी विवाद के खत्म हुआ। सवाल: फाइनल खत्म होने के बाद कैसा महसूस हुआ? अहमद शाह: मैदान पर तो बस काम पर ध्यान था। बाद में जब टीवी पर क्लिप देखी तो समझ आया कि कितना दबाव था। यह मेरे करियर में गर्व का पल रहा। सवाल: फाइनल के बाद हुए विवाद (ट्रॉफी न मिलने) के बारे में आप क्या कहेंगे? अहमद शाह: हम तो मैच के बाद जल्दी निकल आए थे। बाद में पता चला कि ट्रॉफी को लेकर विवाद हुआ। लेकिन, हमारी जिम्मेदारी मैच को सही तरीके से खत्म करना था और वो हमने किया। सवाल: भारत-पाकिस्तान जैसे मैचों में अंपायरिंग करना कैसा लगता है? अहमद शाह: यह हर अंपायर का सपना होता है। दबाव जरूर होता है, लेकिन मेहनत और फोकस से इसे संभाला जा सकता है। सवाल: आगे का टारगेट क्या है? अहमद शाह: चाहूंगा कि और बड़े मैचों में मौका मिले। भारत-पाकिस्तान जैसे हाई-प्रोफाइल मैचों में बार-बार अंपायरिंग करना किसी भी अंपायर के लिए गर्व की बात है। एशिया कप में भारत-पाक मैच के दौरान कई विवाद हुए भारतीय टीम ने 28 सितंबर को एशिया कप फाइनल में पाकिस्तान को हराकर ट्रॉफी अपने नाम की थी। जीत के बाद टीम ने नकवी के हाथों एशिया कप ट्रॉफी लेने से इनकार कर दिया था। भारत ने यह स्टैंड पहलगाम आतंकी हमले के विरोध में लिया था। इसके बाद मोहसिन नकवी ट्रॉफी लेकर दुबई के होटल चले आए थे। फिर पाकिस्तान जाने से पहले उन्होंने ये ट्रॉफी दुबई स्थित ACC ऑफिस में छोड़ दी थी। भारतीय खिलाड़ियों ने इससे पहले पूरे टूर्नामेंट में पाकिस्तानी खिलाड़ियों से हाथ भी नहीं मिलाया था। दूसरी ओर, पाकिस्तानी खिलाड़ियों ने बार-बार 6-0 के इशारे किए थे। वे पाकिस्तान के इस फर्जी दावे को दोहरा रहे थे कि पाकिस्तान ने ऑपरेशन सिंदूर के दौरान भारत के 6 फाइटर जेट गिराए थे। --------------------- भारत-पाकिस्तान मैच से जुड़ी यह खबर पढ़िए... एक टीम में साथ खेल रहे भारत-पाकिस्तान के खिलाड़ी पिछले एशिया कप क्रिकेट टूर्नामेंट को भारत की जीत के साथ-साथ इस बात के लिए भी याद रखा जाएगा कि इसमें भारत और पाकिस्तान के खिलाड़ियों ने आपस में हाथ तक नहीं मिलाया। पहलगाम आतंकी हमला और और ऑपरेशन सिंदूर के बाद पहली बार इस टूर्नामेंट में दोनों टीमों की भिड़ंत हुई थी। दुबई में इनके बीच तीन मैच हुए थे और तीनों ही बार कड़वाहट की अलग-अलग कहानियां सामने आई थीं। पढ़ें पूरी खबर Copyright © 2024-25 DB Corp ltd., All Rights Reserved This website follows the DNPA Code of Ethics.",real,https://www.bhaskar.com,https://www.bhaskar.com/sports/cricket/news/ind-vs-pak-asia-cup-2025-final-umpire-ahmed-shah-pakteen-afghan-refugee-camp-136581328.html
स्टाफ की कमी से इंडिगो की 550 फ्लाइट्स कैंसिल: एयरलाइन बोली- ठीक होने में 3 महीने लगेंगे; DGCA ने सुधार के लिए 4 आदेश दिए1:12,"एविशन सेक्टर के नए सुरक्षा नियमों की वजह से देश की सबसे बड़ी एयरलाइन कंपनी इंडिगो लगातार तीसरे दिन क्रू की कमी से जूझ रही है। इससे इंडिगो के ऑपरेशन पर बुरा असर पड़ा है। न्यूज एजेंसी PTI के अनुसार, गुरुवार को दिल्ली, मुंबई सहित 10 से ज्यादा एयरपोर्ट में इंडिगो की 550 से ज्यादा फ्लाइट्स कैंसिल हुई हैं। दिल्ली एयरपोर्ट पर आज इंडिगो की कुल 172 उड़ानें रद्द हुई हैं। वहीं मुंबई में 118, बेंगलुरु में 100, हैदराबाद में 75, कोलकाता में 35, चेन्नई में 26, गोवा में 11, जयपुर में 4 और इंदौर में 3 उड़ानें रद्द हुई हैं। डायरेक्टोरेट जनरल ऑफ सिविल एविएशन (DGCA) ने गुरुवार को एयरलाइन के अधिकारियों से मुलाकात की। एयरलाइन ने नए नियमों में छूट मांगते हुए कहा कि ऑपरेशन नॉर्मल होने में तीन महीने लग सकते हैं। जिसके बाद DGCA ने इंडिगो को सुधार के लिए कुछ आवश्यक पहलुओं पर काम करने को कहा है। इंडिगो को क्रू भर्ती और ट्रेनिंग का पूरा रोडमैप बताना पड़ेगा। रोस्टर रीस्ट्रक्चरिंग और सेफ्टी असेसमेंट के बारे में भी प्लानिंग करनी पड़ेगी। DGCA ने इंडिगो को हर 15 दिन में प्रोग्रेस रिपोर्ट देने का भी निर्देश दिया है। अब DGCA के नए नियम जानिए DGCA ने 1 नवंबर से पायलटों और अन्य क्रू मेंबर्स के काम से जुड़े नियमों में बदलाव किए हैं। इसे फ्लाइट ड्यूटी टाइम लिमिटेशन (FDTL) नाम दिया गया है। इन्हें दो चरणों में लागू किया गया। पहला चरण 1 जुलाई को लागू हुआ। वहीं 1 नवंबर से दूसरा चरण लागू हुआ। नए नियमों में यात्रियों की सुरक्षा बढ़ाने के लिए पायलटों और क्रू को पर्याप्त आराम देने पर जोर दिया गया है। इस कारण एयरलाइन कंपनियों के पास पायलटों और क्रू मेंबर्स की अचानक कमी पड़ गई है। DGCA ने बताया कि नवंबर में इंडिगो की कुल 1,232 उड़ानें कैंसिल की गईं, जिनमें FDTL नियमों के कारण 755 उड़ानें शामिल हैं।​​​​​​ नागरिक उड्डयन मंत्री ने नाराजगी जताई, बोले- जल्द समस्या सुलझाएं नागरिक उड्डयन मंत्री राममोहन नायडू ने गुरुवार को रिव्यू मीटिंग की। मंत्री ने नाराजगी जताते हुए कहा कि नए नियमों को लेकर तैयारी का इतना समय था, फिर भी स्थिति कैसे बिगड़ गई। नायडू ने एयरलाइन को निर्देश दिया कि फ्लाइट ऑपरेशन जल्द से जल्द सामान्य किए जाएं और हवाई किराए में किसी भी तरह की बढ़ोतरी न की जाए। इसके अलावा देरी या कैंसिलेशन की स्थिति में यात्रियों को होटल, खाना और अन्य सुविधाएं समय पर उपलब्ध कराई जाएं। इंडिगो के पास सबसे ज्यादा प्लेन, इसलिए ज्यादा असर एयरलाइन दिन भर में लगभग 2,300 घरेलू और अंतरराष्ट्रीय उड़ानें ऑपरेट करती है। यह संख्या एअर इंडिया के एक दिन में संचालित उड़ानों की लगभग दोगुनी है। इतने बड़े पैमाने पर यदि 10–20 प्रतिशत उड़ानें भी देर से चलें या रद्द हों, तो इसका मतलब होता है 200–400 उड़ानें प्रभावित होना। हजारों यात्रियों के लिए बड़ी मुश्किलें आना। बुधवार को भी इंडिगो की 200 से ज्यादा उड़ानों पर असर पड़ा था। DGCA के अनुसार, क्रू की कमी इसकी मुख्य वजह है। इंडिगो में यह दिक्कत पिछले महीने से चल रही है। नवंबर में इसकी 1232 उड़ानें रद्द हुईं। मंगलवार को 1400 उड़ानें देरी से चलीं। देश के अलग-अलग एयरपोर्ट्स की तस्वीरें... देशभर के एयरपोर्ट्स के हाल मुंबई एयरपोर्ट: मुंबई एयरपोर्ट पर इंडिगो स्टाफ ने बताया कि गुरुवार को कुल 86 फ्लाइट्स कैंसिल हैं। इनमें 41 फ्लाइट मुंबई आने वाली और 45 मुंबई से दूसरे शहरों में जाने वाली फ्लाइट्स थीं। जयपुर और जोधपुर एयरपोर्ट ​​​​​​: जयपुर में गुरुवार को 3 इंडिगो फ्लाइट कैंसिल हुई है। जोधपुर से 4 इंडिगो फ्लाइट को रद्द किया गया है। इनमें ज्यादातर फ्लाइट्स बेंगलुरु, हैदराबाद, मुंबई और कोलकाता आने-जाने वाली थीं। हैदराबाद एयरपोर्ट: राजीव गांधी इंटरनेशनल एयरपोर्ट के सूत्रों ने बताया कि गुरुवार को यहां से उड़ान भरने वाली इंडिगो की 33 उड़ानें रद्द होने की आशंका है। हैदराबाद आने वाली 35 फ्लाइट्स भी कैसिंल होने की आशंका है। इंडिगो ने बुधवार को हैदराबाद से 19 उड़ानें रद्द कर दी थीं।​​​​​​ इंदौर एयरपोर्ट: मध्य प्रदेश के इंदौर में इंडिगो की तीन फ्लाइट्स रद्द की गई हैं। बुधवार को भी इंडिगो की 18 उड़ानें कैंसिल हुई थीं। एयरलाइन के अनुसार, रद्द की गई उड़ानों में जयपुर, दिल्ली, मुंबई, गोवा, चेन्नई और कोलकाता जैसे प्रमुख रूट शामिल हैं। देश की 60% घरेलू उड़ानें इंडिगो के पास गूगल पर ट्रेंड कर रहा इंडिगो... सोर्स: गूगल ट्रेंड ---------------------------------- ये खबर भी पढ़ें... एअर इंडिया ने एक्सपायर फिटनेस सर्टिफिकेट वाला प्लेन उड़ाया: विमान ने 8 रूट्स पर उड़ान भरी एअर इंडिया ने अपने A-320 नियो प्लेन को फिटनेस सर्टिफिकेट एक्सपायर होने के बाद भी 8 रूट्स पर उड़ाया। 26 नवंबर को एयरलाइन ने नागरिक उड्डयन महानिदेशालय (DGCA) को इसकी जानकारी दी।मामला सामने के बाद DGCA ने प्लेन की उड़ान भरने पर रोक लगा दी है। पूरी खबर पढ़ें...

"ब्लैकबोर्ड- बेटा मर चुका था, मैंने डॉक्टर से कहा-इंजेक्शन लगाओ: चैंपियन बेटा कहता था-दुनिया आपको ‘हार्दिक के पापा’ पुकारेगी, सच भी हुआ लेकिन उसके मरने पर3:32","'उस दिन मेरे बेटे हार्दिक को तेज बुखार था। शरीर टूट रहा था, लेकिन फिर भी उसने कहा- पापा, प्रैक्टिस मिस नहीं कर सकता। वो बिना कुछ खाए घर से निकल गया। जाते-जाते अपनी मां से मुस्कुराकर बोला था-'मां, मेरी पसंद का खाना बना लेना… लौटकर खाऊंगा।' मैदान में खेलते-खेलते अचानक वो बड़ा-सा पोल उसके ऊपर आ गिरा। उसका लीवर फट गया था, अंदर ही अंदर काफी खून बह गया था। जब हॉस्पिटल पहुंचा तो चेहरा पीला पड़ चुका था, होठ सूखकर सफेद पड़ गए थे। मैं उसका हाथ पकड़े बैठा हुआ था, दिल को तो उम्मीद थी कि मेरा बेटा मुझे छोड़कर नहीं जा सकता, लेकिन दिमाग सब समझ चुका था। मैं डॉक्टर से बार-बार कह रहा था इंजेक्शन लगाओ, मेरे बेटे को बचा लो। उसकी एक आंख बिल्कुल स्थिर थी, दूसरी धीरे-धीरे घूम रही थी, सांसें टूट रही थीं। मैं समझ गया था कि मेरा बच्चा.... मेरी जान… मेरे हाथों से फिसल रहा है और मैं कुछ भी नहीं कर पा रहा था।' ब्लैकबोर्ड में इस बार हरियाणा के उन परिवारों की स्याह कहानी, जिनके बच्चे नेशनल लेवल के खिलाड़ी थे, लेकिन प्रशासन की लापरवाही से अपनी जान गंवा बैठे। हरियाणा के रोहतक जिले का लाखन माजरा गांव में एक अजीब सा सन्नाटा पसरा था। बास्केटबॉल का पोल गिरने से मारे गए हार्दिक के घर गांव के लोग इकट्ठा हुए थे। निर्मला अपने बेटे हार्दिक का नाम ले-लेकर बेहोश हो जा रही थीं। पिता संदीप राठी गुमसुम दरवाजे पर बैठे बाहर की ओर देख रहे थे जैसे किसी के आने का इंतजार हो। जिस आंगन में कभी हार्दिक की बास्केटबॉल प्रैक्टिस की आवाज गूंजती थी, आज वही आंगन मातम में डूबा था। दीवार पर बास्केटबॉल नेट अब खाली था जिसमें बॉल डालने वाला हार्दिक अब इस दुनिया में नहीं था। घर का माहौल भारी, मां का हाल बेहाल, और पिता संदीप लंबी सांस लेकर बोलते हैं, ‘हार्दिक 6 बार नेशनल लेवल पर खेल चुका था। तीन बार सब-जूनियर लेवल की प्रतियोगिताओं में हिस्सा लिया। उसका रूटीन किसी प्रोफेशनल एथलीट की तरह था। सुबह 4 बजे स्टेडियम जाता, फिर घर आकर नाश्ता करता और 9 बजे दोबारा प्रैक्टिस पर लौट जाता। शाम को 4 बजे फिर ग्राउंड में होता और रात 8 बजे घर आता। बस एक ही सपना था- देश के लिए गोल्ड मेडल लाना।’ संदीप ये कहते हुए फफक कर रो पड़ते हैं। अपनी हथेलियों की रेखाएं देखते हुए कहते हैं- ‘ मेरा बेटा हमेशा कहता था कि एक दिन दुनिया आपको हार्दिक के पापा के नाम से पहचानेगी। लोग कहेंगे कि देखो, हार्दिक के पापा जा रहे हैं। अब लोग सच में मुझे हार्दिक के पापा कहकर बुलाते हैं, लेकिन ये सब सुनने के लिए वो नहीं है। हमारा घर सूना हो गया है।’ संदीप अपने छोटे बेटे प्रतीक को पास बैठाकर धीमी आवाज में कहते हैं, ‘उस हादसे ने इसे अंदर से तोड़ दिया है। दोनों भाई हर शाम साथ-साथ बास्केटबॉल खेलते थे। खेलते हुए हार्दिक उसकी गलतियां सुधारता, कंधे पर हाथ रखकर हिम्मत बढ़ाता। अब प्रतीक जब स्टेडियम में कदम रखता है, तो हर कोना हार्दिक की याद दिलाता है। हार्दिक की मां खुद को संभाल नहीं पा रहीं। बेटे की तस्वीर देखते-देखते बेहोश हो जाती हैं। होश आता है, तो पहला सवाल यही पूछती है कि हार्दिक कहां है? जैसे उनका मन अभी भी उस एक पल पर अटका हुआ हो, जहां से जिंदगी आगे बढ़ने को तैयार ही नहीं।' हादसे वाले दिन को याद करते हुए संदीप की आंखें फिर भर आती हैं। वो कहते हैं कि 'जिस दिन हादसा हुआ वो स्टेडियम में डंकी प्रैक्टिस कर रहा था। वो कहते हैं उसी दौरान हादसा हो गया पोल उसके सीने पर गिर गया और उसने वहीं दम तोड़ दिया। उसका लीवर फट गया था। 20 मिनट में वो अस्पताल पहुंच गया लेकिन डॉक्टर ने कहा कि ये तो स्पॉट पर ही चला गया था।' संदीप बताते हैं कि स्टेडियम ठीक कराने के लिए हम मंत्री से मिले, मुख्यमंत्री को पत्र भेजा। कहा गया कि एमपी कोटे से 18 लाख रुपए आएंगे। फिर बताया कि 2023 में 12 लाख और भेजे गए हैं, लेकिन सबकुछ अब तक केवल कागजों में हैं। अगर वक्त रहते उस पोल की मरम्मत हो जाती, तो आज हार्दिक हमारे साथ होता। देश ने एक अच्छा खिलाड़ी खो दिया… हमने अपना बेटा।’ संदीप की आवाज थोड़ी तेज होती है, जैसे भीतर जमा हुआ गुस्सा बाहर आ रहा हो। वह कहते हैं, ‘हरियाणा से इतने खिलाड़ी निकलते हैं, इतने मेडल आते हैं… लेकिन कोई नहीं देखता कि उसके पीछे हमारे बच्चों और पूरे परिवारों की कितनी मेहनत होती है। मेडल जीतकर खिलाड़ी लौटते हैं तो सरकार आगे आ जाती है- माला पहनाती है, फोटो खिंचवाती है, लेकिन जब वही खिलाड़ी किसी मुश्किल में फंस जाता है, या उसकी जान चली जाती है… तब उसका परिवार बिल्कुल अकेला रह जाता है।’ हार्दिक के छोटे भाई, प्रतीक राठी कहते हैं- ‘उस दिन हम दोनों भाई मैदान में प्रैक्टिस कर रहे थे। मैं हार्दिक को बॉल पास कर रहा था, उसने कहा तू रहने दे, मैं अकेले प्रैक्टिस कर लूंगा। मैं वहीं आराम करने बैठ गया। तभी अचानक, झटका लगते ही बास्केटबॉल का पोल उसके ऊपर गिर गया।’ प्रतीक की आंखें भर आती हैं और उनकी आवाज टूट जाती है। ‘मेरा भाई मेरे और हमारी टीम के लिए कोच जैसा था। खेलते समय वह मेरी हर गलती पकड़ता और सुधारता था। आज जब वह इस दुनिया में नहीं है, तो मैंने ठान लिया है- अब से बास्केटबॉल उसी के नाम खेलूंगा। उसके सपने पूरे करूंगा। अगले महीने मुझे अपनी पहली राष्ट्रीय प्रतियोगिता खेलनी है, लेकिन उसके बिना मैदान पर प्रैक्टिस करना बेहद मुश्किल हो रहा है।’ हार्दिक के दोस्त रोहित बताते हैं, ‘उस दिन हार्दिक मैदान पर ड्रिब्लिंग प्रैक्टिस कर रहा था। मैं बिल्कुल उसके पास खड़ा था। जैसे ही उसने रिंग पकड़ी, पोल अचानक टूटकर सीधा उसकी छाती पर गिर गया। तुरंत सभी ने पोल हटाया और उसे अस्पताल के लिए ले गए। रास्ते भर वह बस यही कह रहा था छाती में बहुत दर्द हो रहा है। अस्पताल पहुंचने से पहले ही उसकी मौत हो गई।’ रोहित की आवाज में टूटन है, लेकिन वे आगे बताते हैं, ‘हम पांच साल से साथ प्रैक्टिस कर रहे थे। वह हमेशा कहता था कि हम दोनों एक साथ भारत के लिए खेलेंगे और देश के लिए मेडल लाएंगे। हमारा मुख्य ठिकाना अब स्टेडियम बन गया था, लेकिन अब वही जगह डर की वजह बन गई है। जब तक स्टेडियम की व्यवस्थाएं पूरी तरह सुरक्षित नहीं होंगी, ऐसे हादसे होते रहेंगे। बास्केटबॉल का दूसरा पोल भी खराब स्थिति में है- वह भी कभी गिर सकता है। इस हादसे के बाद हम अभी तक प्रैक्टिस के लिए मैदान पर नहीं गए हैं।’ रोहित आगे कहते हैं, ‘हार्दिक हमारी टीम का सबसे उम्दा खिलाड़ी था। उसकी ऊंचाई 6 फुट 2 इंच थी। वह टीम का सबसे लंबा, सबसे मजबूत और सबसे समर्पित खिलाड़ी था। टीम को हमेशा साथ लेकर चलता था। उसके बिना हम अपनी टीम की कल्पना भी नहीं कर सकते।’ हार्दिक के कोच मोहित, आंखों में उदासी लिए, याद करते हुए कहते हैं, ‘वह एक अलग ही तरह का खिलाड़ी था। समय का बिल्कुल पाबंद, एक मिनट भी लेट नहीं होता था। बड़े खिलाड़ियों की इज्जत करता और छोटे खिलाड़ियों का हाथ पकड़कर उनके खेल सुधारता। मुझे पूरा भरोसा था कि वह एक दिन देश, अपने गांव और परिवार का नाम रोशन करेगा।’ कोच की आवाज कड़वी हो जाती है और वे कहते हैं, ‘यह हार्दिक की मौत नहीं है; सरकार की लापरवाही के कारण हुआ मर्डर है। अगर सरकार एक इंडोर स्टेडियम तक नहीं बना सकती, तो और क्या कर सकती है? वह बस पांच लाख का मुआवजा देकर अपनी जिम्मेदारी से बचने की कोशिश कर रही है। उसका जमीर खत्म हो चुका है, लेकिन हम नहीं झुकेंगे। हम चंदा इकट्ठा करके हार्दिक के नाम पर इंडोर स्टेडियम बनवाएंगे।’ मोहित एक और याद साझा करते हुए कहते हैं, ‘अप्रैल का महीना था। राष्ट्रीय स्तर के मुकाबले में हमारा मैच दिल्ली की टीम से था। यह तीसरे स्थान के लिए मुकाबला था। उस दिन हार्दिक के पैर में सूजन थी, लेकिन उसने कहा- ‘हमें यह मैच जीतना है।' 'वह मैदान पर बिल्कुल अलग लेवल पर खेल रहा था। अंत में हमने एकतरफा जीत दर्ज की और यह पूरी तरह हार्दिक की बदौलत था। सच कहूं तो ऐसे खिलाड़ी रोज पैदा नहीं होते, लेकिन हम उन्हें इतनी आसानी से खो देते हैं, सिर्फ इसलिए कि स्टेडियम का पोल टूटा हुआ है और सरकारें आंखें मूंदे सो रही हैं।’ पांच अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर के मैच खेल चुके हार्दिक के गांव के वरिष्ठ खिलाड़ी नरेंद्र याद करते हैं, ‘हार्दिक एक अनुशासित खिलाड़ी था। उसकी बॉडी, चाल, हर पहलू इस खेल के लिए पूरी तरह फिट था। मैं खुद पांच अंतरराष्ट्रीय मैच खेल चुका हूं, लेकिन कह सकता हूं कि हार्दिक मुझसे भी आगे जाने वाला खिलाड़ी था। वह कभी प्रैक्टिस से नहीं भागता था, बीमार होने पर भी। उसके समर्पण और मेहनत ने हम सभी को प्रेरित किया।’ नरेंद्र आगे बताते हैं, ‘हमारे लाखन माजरा स्टेडियम से अब तक 10-12 अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर के खिलाड़ी निकले हैं और 30-40 खिलाड़ियों ने राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर खेला है। इसे ‘खेल गांव’ कहा जाता है। कुछ खिलाड़ी आर्मी या नेवी में हैं, लेकिन इस मैदान की अनदेखी सरकार ने की है। अगर स्टेडियम का रखरखाव समय पर किया गया होता, तो आज हार्दिक हमारे बीच होता।’ उन्होंने पूरे देश की तस्वीर भी उजागर करते हुए कहा, ‘अगर आज पूरे देश में 100 बास्केटबॉल कोर्ट हैं, तो करीब 80 असुरक्षित स्थिति में हैं। हमारी सरकार से गुजारिश है कि इस हादसे से सबक ले और इस मैदान की मरम्मत कराई जाए। यहां बास्केटबॉल, कबड्डी और हॉकी के कई खिलाड़ी देश का नाम रोशन कर चुके हैं, लेकिन बास्केटबॉल के लिए कभी सरकारी कोच नहीं आया। हम सीनियर खिलाड़ी ही जूनियर्स को ट्रेनिंग देते हैं और स्टेडियम का रखरखाव भी खुद करते हैं। अगर यहां सरकारी कोच हो, तो खिलाड़ी और ऊंचाइयों तक पहुंच सकते हैं।’ हार्दिक को याद करते हुए उनकी दादी संतोष भावुक हो उठती हैं। आंखों में आंसू भरे हुए वे कहती हैं, ‘जब भी हार्दिक खेलकर आता, सबसे पहले मुझे ही अपनी जीत और मेहनत के बारे में बताता। मेरे हाथ से दी गई हर चीज वह बड़े प्यार से खाता था। वह बचपन से ही खेल के पीछे पागल था। तीन साल का था तभी से अपने पिता को साथ लेकर बॉल खेलता था। हमने सोचा था कि एक दिन वह खेल के जरिए बड़ा अफसर बनेगा और गांव का नाम रोशन करेगा… लेकिन ऐसा नहीं हुआ।’ हार्दिक के घर पर मौजूद गांव के बाकी लोग भी उसकी अच्छाइयों को याद करते हैं। वे बताते हैं, ‘वह सिर्फ एक खिलाड़ी ही नहीं, बल्कि एक नेक इंसान था। रास्ते में यदि कोई बुजुर्ग मिलता, तो वह उन्हें अपनी स्कूटी से घर तक पहुंचा देता था।’ बहादुरगढ़ में अमन के घर का माहौल भी गम से भारी था। हार्दिक की मौत से ठीक एक दिन पहले अमन पर भी बास्केटबॉल कोर्ट का पोल गिर गया था। उनके पिता सुरेश आंखों में दर्द और भावुकता लिए हमें घटना सुनाते हैं। ‘उस दिन घर में मेहमान आए हुए थे, खुशी का माहौल था। अमन स्कूल से आया था और ट्रेनिंग के लिए स्टेडियम जाना चाहता था, लेकिन मैं और उसके बड़े भाई ने उसे रोक दिया। मां ने भी कहा, ‘आज मत जाओ,’ लेकिन वह नहीं माना,’ सुरेश की आवाज कांपती है। वे आगे बताते हैं, ‘अमन रोज शहीद ब्रिगेडियर होशियार सिंह स्टेडियम में प्रैक्टिस करता था। उसका एक ही सपना था- ओलिंपिक में भारत का नाम रोशन करना।’ सुरेश याद करते हैं कि उस दिन उन्हें अस्पताल से फोन आया, ‘आपके लड़के के साथ दुर्घटना हो गई है। स्टेडियम से उसे सिविल अस्पताल ले जाया गया है। आप लोग जल्दी आ जाइए।’ 'अस्पताल पहुंचे ही थे कि डॉक्टरों ने उसे तुरंत रोहतक पीजीआई रेफर कर दिया। वहां हमें अल्ट्रासाउंड कराने को कहा। हम एक घंटे तक उसी में उलझे रहे। जब तक अल्ट्रासाउंड हुआ, उसके पेट में काफी ब्लीडिंग हो चुकी थी। रिपोर्ट आई, लेकिन तब तक उसकी जान चली गई। अगर समय पर इलाज मिलता, तो मेरा बच्चा आज जीवित होता,’ सुरेश का गला भर आता है। वे आगे अफसोस जताते हैं, ‘उस दिन मेरा बेटा मुझसे पानी मांग रहा था, लेकिन डॉक्टर की अनुमति के बिना उसे नहीं दे सकता था। जब डॉक्टर से बात करके पानी देने गया, तब तक उसकी जान चली गई थी। आखिरी बार उसे पानी भी नहीं पिला सका।’ सुरेश का गुस्सा डॉक्टरों और प्रशासन पर है। ‘जब उसकी मौत हो गई, डॉक्टर अपनी गलती छिपाने में लगे रहे। उसे आईसीयू में भर्ती कर दिया और 24 घंटे केवल कागजी कार्रवाई में उलझे रहे। यहां तक कि उसकी पोस्टमॉर्टम रिपोर्ट में उसका जेंडर बदल दिया गया। उम्र को 15 साल की जगह 25 साल लिखा गया और हादसे का समय भी बदल दिया गया। अधिकारी अपनी गलती छिपाने के लिए उसे क्रिकेट खिलाड़ी दिखा रहे थे, जबकि वह हर वक्त बास्केटबॉल लेकर घूमता था।’ सुरेश अपनी आवाज में दर्द के साथ कहते हैं, ‘सच यही है कि मेरे बेटे की मौत पीजीआई में डॉक्टरों की लापरवाही और खेल प्रशासन की बदइंतजामी से हुई। मैं राजनीति नहीं चाहता। बस उसे न्याय मिले। निष्पक्ष जांच हो, सीसीटीवी फुटेज को जांचा जाए और जिम्मेदारों को सजा मिले।’ अमन की बड़ी बहन मानसी हाथ में बास्केटबॉल लिए बैठी हैं। उनकी आंखों में दर्द और यादें दोनों झलक रही हैं। मानसी कहती हैं, ‘अमन दिन-रात इसी बॉल के साथ रहता था। जिस दिन उसने पहला मेडल जीता, वह सबसे पहले मुझे ही दिखाने आया। उसकी आंखों में खुशी ऐसी चमक रही थी, जो कभी भूल नहीं सकती।’ ‘वह स्कूल में हमेशा अच्छे नंबर लाता और खाने-पीने में हर चीज पसंद करता था। उस दिन उसे देखकर मैं बहुत घबरा गई थी। मैंने अपने मोजे उतारकर उसके पैर में पहनाए थे।’ कहते-कहते मानसी फफककर रो पड़ती हैं। अमन के चचेरे भाई रोहित की आवाज में गुस्सा और दर्द दोनों झलकते हैं। वह कहते हैं, ‘अमन के इलाज में लापरवाही हुई। हमें अस्पताल में अल्ट्रासाउंड के लिए एक घंटे तक इंतजार करना पड़ा। वहां मौजूद डॉक्टर की ओर से कोई ध्यान नहीं दिया गया। अंत में जब रिपोर्ट आई, उसी डॉक्टर ने कहा कि यह गंभीर मामला था,’ रोहित की आंखें भर आती हैं। ‘मैं मेडिकल लाइन से जुड़ा हूं, मुझे समझ में आ गया था कि अमन की मौत हो चुकी है। डॉक्टरों ने अपनी गलती छिपाने के लिए उसे सीपीआर दिया और वेंटिलेटर पर रखा। हाथ में पोस्टमॉर्टम रिपोर्ट दिखाते हुए रोहित कहते हैं, ‘इसमें अस्पताल ले जाने का समय, उम्र और जेंडर सब गलत लिखा गया है। आखिर इतना सब कैसे गलत हो सकता है?’ अमन की दादी कहती हैं कि जिस दिन यह हादसा हुआ, उसी दिन घर में खुशी का माहौल था। उस दिन सब उसे स्टेडियम जाने से रोक रहे थे, लेकिन नहीं माना। किसे पता था उसका आखिरी दिन होगा। हाथ में उसकी तस्वीर लेकर रोते हुए दादी कहती हैं कि वो मुझे ‘मम्मा’ कहकर बुलाता था। उसकी आवाज, उसकी हंसी, उसकी शरारतें सब अब यादें बन गए। हमारा सहारा, हमारा चिराग, हमारा अमन हमें छोड़कर चला गया। ------------------------------------------ 1- ब्लैकबोर्ड- बेटी ने मारा तो घर छोड़ा:बस के नीचे मरने पहुंचे, भाई ने फर्जी साइन से पैसे हड़पे, वृद्धाश्रम में रोज सुबह सोचते

"भास्कर एक्सक्लूसिवपैपराजी को मीडिया नहीं मानतीं जया बच्चन: भूतनाथ के डायरेक्टर ने बताया घातक, बोले- पैप्स के अंदर कोई मान मर्यादा नहीं होती है2:28","ये काफी अजीब है। मेरा मीडिया से रिश्ता बहुत अच्छा है, मैं मीडिया की देन हूं, लेकिन पैपराजी से मेरा रिश्ता जीरो है। क्या इन लोगों ने कोई ट्रेनिंग ली है, जो ये देश के लोगों को रिप्रेजेंट कर रहे हैं। क्या आप इन्हें मीडिया कहते हैं। मैं मीडिया से आती हूं, मेरे फादर एक जर्नलिस्ट थे। मैं उन लोगों का बहुत सम्मान करती हूं। लेकिन ये जो बाहर गंदे तंग कपड़े पहनकर, हाथ में मोबाइल लेकर, उन्हें लगता है कि उनके पास मोबाइल है, तो वो आपकी पिक्चर ले लेंगे, और कुछ भी कह देंगे, ये जिस तरह के कमेंट करते हैं, ये किस तरह के लोग हैं, कहां से आते हैं, किस तरह का एजुकेशन है, क्या बैकग्राउंड है। क्या ये हमें रिप्रेजेंट करेंगे। ये बयान एक्ट्रेस और सपा सासंद जया बच्चन ने पैपराजी को लेकर दिया है। उनके इस बयान ने सोशल मीडिया और फिल्म इंडस्ट्री में एक नई बहस छेड़ दी है। जहां कुछ ने उन्हें घमंडी और क्लासिस्ट कहा, जबकि अन्य ने उनके फ्रैंक अंदाज की तारीफ की। ये पहली बार नहीं है, जब जया ने पैपराजी को लेकर कुछ कहा है। वो पहले भी कई मौकों पर उन्हें फटकारते नजर आ चुकी हैं, जिसमें से उनका ""बदतमीजी मत करो"" जैसे कमेंट वायरल हो चुके हैं। इस मामले में हमने फिल्म इंडस्ट्री के लोगों, मीडियाकर्मी और से बातचीत की, और अब जानते हैं उनकी राय। पैपराजी से बचने के लिए स्टार्स को बाउंसर्स की जरूरत पड़ती है। भूतनाथ के डायरेक्टर विवेक शर्मा कहते हैं- जर्नलिस्ट और पैपराजी में बिल्कुल फर्क है। पैपराजी के अंदर किसी प्रकार की मान मर्यादा नहीं होती है।﻿ यह लोग बहुत तंग करते हैं। ये न्यू बॉन्ड जैसी नई जनरेशन की भीड़ है। इनके पास कोई आत्म-सम्मान या मर्यादा नहीं होती। ये एयरपोर्ट के बाहर खड़े रहते हैं और जैसे ही कोई निकलता है, उनकी फोटो खींचते और वीडियो बनाते हैं। बेसिकली ये प्लांटेड होते हैं। जो पीआर डिजाइन करते हैं उनके द्वारा प्लांडेट होते हैं।﻿ मतलब ये लोग कंपनियों या सेलिब्रिटी के प्रचार के लिए जानबूझकर वहां भेजे जाते हैं। जब कोई एयरपोर्ट या जिम से निकलता है, तो ये फटाफट फोटो खींच लेते हैं। जैसे कोई हीरोइन जिम से निकल रही हो, तो उसके वीडियो और फोटो लेकर मीम्स बनाते हैं। यह बहुत ही गलत और अपमानजनक बात है, जो पूरी तरह से मान मर्यादा तोड़ती है। मीडिया और पैपराजी में बहुत बड़ा फर्क है।﻿ मीडिया वे लोग होते हैं जो पढ़े-लिखे होकर जर्नलिज्म करते हैं। वे ऐसी बेहूदा हरकतें नहीं करते। जबकि पैपराजी ऐसी ही गंदी हरकतें करते हैं, जिससे सितारों को बचने के लिए बाउंसर्स की जरूरत पड़ती है। मैं सतीश शाह के अंतिम संस्कार में गया था। वहां लोग चिता के सामने शूट करने की बात कर रहे थे। मैं और फराह खान बात कर रहे थे, तभी कोई आकर रिकॉर्ड करने लगा। किसी का जबरदस्ती वीडियो बनाना सही नहीं है। कई बार तो सितारे भी ऐसे पैपराजी को हायर करते हैं। वो किसी के अंतिम संस्कार में जाकर उनके चलते हुए शॉट्स भी डालते हैं। जो सांत्वना देने गए हों, उन्हें ही पीआर करने में बदल देते हैं। ये पैपराजी बहुत ज्यादा घातक हैं। इनको कंट्रोल करना बहुत जरूरी है।﻿ इन लोगों की हरकतों को रोकना बहुत अहम है। पैपराजी﻿ का तरीका गलत एड गुर और फिल्ममेकर प्रभाकर शुक्ल कहते हैं- जया बच्चन जी ने जो सवाल उठाया है, वह उनके अनुसार सही हो सकता है। लेकिन मीडिया के कई पहलू हैं। पैपराजी﻿ भी एक पहलू है, जो आज की दुनिया में बहुत जल्दी वायरल होता है। यह सनसनीखेज﻿ होता है। इसके अलावा अखबार, टीवी चैनल और पोर्टल अपनी अपनी गति से काम करते हैं। अखबार में खबरें कल आएंगी, न्यूज चैनल पर आपको चीजें लाइव या शाम तक दिखेंगी। लेकिन पैपराजी﻿ और सोशल मीडिया आपकी खबरों को तुरंत वायरल कर देते हैं, जिसका फायदा और नुकसान दोनों होता है। मुझे लगता है कि पैपराजी﻿ भी एक तरह का मीडिया है। भले ही आप इसे मीडिया न मानें, यह मीडिया कहलाता है, चाहे संगठित हो या असंगठित। पैपराजी﻿ मीडिया होता है, लेकिन तरीका गलत हो सकता है। पैपराजी का शिक्षित होना जरूरी बॉलीवुड हेल्पलाइन के जर्नलिस्ट नसीम खान कहते हैं- पैपराजी खासतौर से मुंबई की चॉल से आते हैं और ज्यादा पढ़े लिखे नहीं होते। आर्थिक रूप से भी मजबूत नहीं होते। पैपराजी के लिए सिर्फ इतना कहना चाहूंगा कि जिनके लिए वह काम कर रहे हैं उनकी जिम्मेदारी बनती है कि उन्हें इतना शिक्षित करें कि किसके साथ किस तरह का बर्ताव करना चाहिए। पैपराजी कल्चर की शुरुआत कैसे हुई? पैपराजी कल्चर की शुरुआत 1960 में इटालवी फिल्म 'ला डोल्से विटा' से मानी जाती है, जहां एक किरदार 'पैपराजो' नामक फोटोग्राफर सितारों का पीछा करता दिखाया गया, जिससे यह शब्द प्रसिद्ध हुआ। इससे पहले 19वीं सदी में ही घुसपैठिए फोटो पत्रकारिता प्रचलित थी, लेकिन पोर्टेबल कैमरों के आविष्कार ने इसे बढ़ावा दिया। भारत में पैपराजी कल्चर 2000 के दशक की शुरुआत में उभरा, जब डिजिटल मीडिया और वेबसाइट्स जैसे सांताबांता, ग्लैमशाम ने बॉलीवुड सितारों की तस्वीरों की मांग बढ़ाई। योगेन शाह को भारत का पहला पैपराजी माना जाता है, जिन्होंने 2002 में सुभाष घई की बेटी मेघना की शादी के बाहर सितारों की तस्वीरें लेकर इसकी नींव रखी। मानव मंगलानी, विरल भयानी और वरिंदर चावला जैसे फोटोग्राफरों ने मुंबई में इस संस्कृति को आगे बढ़ाया, जो एयरपोर्ट, जिम और इवेंट्स पर सितारों का पीछा करते हैं। 2016 में तैमूर अली खान के जन्म ने इसे चरम पर पहुंचाया, जिससे स्टार किड्स की तस्वीरें वायरल होने लगीं। अब यह सोशल मीडिया से जुड़कर ब्रांड प्रमोशन का माध्यम बन गया है। पैपराजी कल्चर ने गोपनीयता का उल्लंघन किया है, जैसा 1997 में प्रिंसेस डायना की मौत के बाद वैश्विक बहस हुई। बॉलीवुड में आलिया भट्ट, करीना कपूर जैसे सितारों ने बच्चों की तस्वीरों पर आपत्ति जताई, लेकिन भारत में अभी सख्त कानून नहीं हैं। यह सेलिब्रिटी इमेज बनाने में सहायक है, पर मानसिक दबाव भी बढ़ाता है। रणबीर के बॉडीगार्ड ने पैपराजी को रोका हाल ही में रणबीर कपूर फिल्ममेकर संजय लीला भंसाली के ऑफिस के बाहर स्पॉट किए गए। एक्टर अपनी अपकमिंग फिल्म 'लव एंड वॉर' की शूटिंग के सिलसिले में भंसाली से मिलने पहुंचे थे। रणबीर जैसे ही वहां पहुंचे, पहले से मौजूद पैपराजी उन्हें क्लिक करने के लिए आवाज देने लगी। इस बीच, रणबीर के बॉडीगार्ड और सुरक्षाकर्मी उन्हें एक तरफ हटने के लिए कहते देखे गए। बॉडीगार्ड का रवैया देख वहां मौजूद पैपराजी बुरी तरह चिढ़ गए। उन्होंने दावा किया उन्हें एक्टर की फोटो लेने के लिए बुलाया गया था। उनमें से एक ने कहा कि उनके पास सबूत के तौर पर मैसेज है। वायरल वीडियो में एक पैपराजी को कहते सुना जा सकता है- ‘अरे भाई बुलाया है... क्या कर रहे हो। अरे मैसेज है हम सबके पास। ऐसा क्या कर रहे हो।’ हालांकि, कुछ ही मिनट बाद रणबीर अपनी कार से बाहर निकलते हैं और अंदर जाने से पहले पैपराजी के लिए पोज देते हैं। सनी देओल ने पैपराजी का कैमरा छीना धर्मेंद्र के निधन (24 नवंबर 2025) के बाद सनी देओल पैपराजी पर भड़के। अस्पताल डिस्चार्ज के समय घर के बाहर निजी पलों को रिकॉर्ड करने पर उन्होंने ""शर्म नहीं आती?"" कहा। 3 दिसंबर 2025 को हरिद्वार में अस्थि विसर्जन के दौरान भी सनी ने चुपके से वीडियो बनाने वाले पैपराजी का कैमरा छीन लिया।​ निकितिन धीर ने पैपराजी को गिद्धों जैसा बताया जैकी श्रॉफ ने नवंबर 2025 में धर्मेंद्र स्वास्थ्य खबरों पर पैपराजी की कवरेज से नाराजगी जताई। निकितिन धीर ने उन्हें ""गिद्धों जैसा"" बताकर आलोचना की। आलिया भट्ट ने अगस्त 2025 में अपनी बिल्डिंग में घुसने पर पैपराजी को ""निकलो बाहर"" कहकर भगाया। इसके अलावा सिद्धार्थ मल्होत्रा ने अप्रैल 2025 में प्रेग्नेंट कियारा आडवाणी की फोटो खींचने पर पैपराजी पर गुस्सा निकाला।​ करण जौहर, मधुर भंडारकर, अमीषा पटेल ने भी पैपराजी के असभ्य व्यवहार पर सार्वजनिक रूप से नाराजगी जताई थी। Copyright © 2024-25 DB Corp ltd., All Rights Reserved This website follows the DNPA Code of Ethics.",real,https://www.bhaskar.com,https://www.bhaskar.com/entertainment/bollywood/news/jaya-bachchan-does-not-consider-paparazzi-as-media-136576282.html
"दावा: ब्राइड ने शाहरुख संग डांस करने से किया इनकार: जुबान केसरी बुलवाने के लिए एक्टर के पीछे पड़ी दुल्हन, जानिए क्या है सच्चाई1:26","हाल ही में शाहरुख खान दिल्ली की एक हाई-प्रोफाइल शादी का हिस्सा बने थे। इस हाई प्रोफाइल शादी के कई वीडियो सोशल मीडिया पर वायरल हुए थे। उनमें से एक वीडियो को लेकर दावा किया जा रहा था कि दुल्हन ने किंग खान के साथ डांस करने से मना कर दिया था। हालांकि, इस दावे के पीछे की सच्चाई कुछ और ही है। दरअसल, एक्स पर पोस्ट किए वीडियो में नजर आता है कि शाहरुख स्टेज पर पठान के गाने चलैया पर डांस कर रहे हैं, जबकि दुल्हन पास में खड़ी है। वीडियो को पोस्ट कर कैप्शन में लिखा गया- ‘शाहरुख खान ने पैसों के लिए किसी अरबपति की शादी में डांस किया और यहां तक ​​कि ब्राइड ने भी उनके साथ डांस करने से इनकार कर दिया।’ हालांकि, इस क्लिप की सच्चाई कुछ और है। एक्स पर क्लिप को क्रॉप करके पोस्ट किया गया है। ओरिजनल वीडियो में, शाहरुख और दूल्हा साथ में फिल्म पठान के गाने पर परफॉर्म कर रहे हैं। दुल्हा एक्टर के स्टेप्स को मैच करने की कोशिश कर रहा है, जबकि दुल्हन दोनों के बीच खड़ी होकर डांस को एंजॉय कर रही है। वहीं, शाहरुख से जुड़ा एक और वीडियो वायरल है, जो कि किसी दूसरी शादी का है। इस वीडियो में शाहरुख दुल्हन की डिमांड की वजह से थोड़ी असहज स्थिति में नजर आ रहे हैं। दरअसल, ब्राइड ने अचानक से एक्टर से उनके विमल पान मसाला एड की फेमस टैगलाइन ‘बोलो जुबान केसरी’ बोलने को कहा। दुल्हन की इस डिमांड पर शाहरुख ने स्थिति संभालते हुए मजाकिया अंदाज में जवाब दिया। उन्होंने मजाक में कहा-'एक बार बिजनेस वाले के साथ काम कर लो, तो वो तुम्हें कभी भूलने नहीं देते।' फिर उन्होंने दुल्हन को रोकने की कोशिश करते हुए कहा- 'भगवान तुम्हारा भला करे, अच्छे काम करती रहो, लेकिन क्या मुझे यहां सचमुच जुबान केसरी कहना चाहिए?' जब दुल्हन ने जिद की और एक बार कहने को कहा, तो शाहरुख ने जवाब दिया- ‘अरे नहीं, अब ये बैन हो गया है। ऐसी बातें मत करो, तुम मुझे भी बैन करवा दोगी। बस यहीं चुप रहो।’ फिर भी जब दुल्हन ने अपनी जिद जारी रखी, तो शाहरुख ने मजाक करते हुए पूछा- ‘तुम मेरी फैन हो या विमल की?'

"जरूरत की खबर- सर्दियों में गर्म पानी से न नहाएं: बढ़ती ड्राइनेस, डॉक्टर से जानें 11 रिस्क फैक्टर्स, 9 हेल्दी विंटर बेदिंग हैबिट्स1:31","सर्दियों में गर्म पानी से नहाने में बड़ी राहत महसूस होती है, लेकिन यह नुकसानदेह हो सकता है। दरअसल, जब शरीर गर्म पानी के संपर्क में आता है तो बॉडी टेम्प्रेचर तेजी से बढ़ता है। इससे ब्लड वेसल्स फैल जाती हैं, हार्ट रेट बढ़ती है और ब्लड प्रेशर कम-ज्यादा होने लगता है। गर्म पानी से त्वचा की नेचुरल ऑयल लेयर खत्म हो जाती है, जिससे स्किन ड्राई और इरिटेटेड हो जाती है। बार-बार ऐसे नहाने से बाल झड़ने, थकान महसूस होने और इम्यून सिस्टम में कमजोरी जैसी समस्याएं हो सकती हैं। लंबे समय तक यह आदत स्किन एजिंग, एलर्जी और एग्जिमा जैसी प्रॉब्लम भी बढ़ा सकती है। इसलिए आराम के लिए बहुत गर्म पानी से नहाना शरीर के नेचुरल बैलेंस को बिगाड़ देता है। बेहतर है कि पानी थोड़ा गुनगुना रखें, ताकि ठंड से राहत भी मिले और शरीर को नुकसान भी न पहुंचे। इसलिए ‘जरूरत की खबर’ में आज सर्दियों में नहाने के तरीके पर बात करेंगे। साथ ही जानेंगे कि- एक्सपर्ट: सवाल: सर्दियों में गर्म पानी से नहाने से क्या होता है? जवाब: गर्म पानी के संपर्क में आते ही स्किन की ब्लड वेसल्स फैल जाती हैं। इससे ब्लड फ्लो तेज हो जाता है और शरीर कुछ देर के लिए गर्म महसूस होता है। हालांकि, नहाने के बाद जब शरीर ठंडी हवा के संपर्क में आता है, तो वेसल्स अचानक सिकुड़ जाती हैं। ऐसे में अगर किसी को दिल से जुड़ी बीमारियां हैं। उसे गंभीर समस्या ओं का सामना करना पड़ सकता है। सवाल: गर्म पानी से नहाने के क्या नुकसान हैं? जवाब: किसी भी मौसम में गर्म पानी से नहाना सेहत के लिए नुकसानदेह है। गर्म पानी त्वचा की नेचुरल ऑयल लेयर को हटा देता है, जिससे स्किन ड्राई और इरिटेटेड हो जाती है। बार-बार गर्म पानी से नहाने से बाल झड़ने लगते हैं और स्कैल्प ड्राई हो जाती है। इसके अलावा, लगातार गर्म पानी से नहाने से स्किन एजिंग तेज होती है, यानी झुर्रियां जल्दी दिखाई देने लगती हैं। बहुत गर्म पानी से शरीर का टेम्प्रेचर तेजी से बढ़ता है, जिससे ब्लड प्रेशर और हार्ट रेट अस्थायी रूप से बढ़ सकती है। जिन लोगों की स्किन संवेदनशील है, उन्हें एलर्जी या रैशेज भी हो सकते हैं। इसके सभी नुकसान ग्राफिक में देखिए- सवाल: बहुत गर्म पानी से नहाने से हार्ट पर क्या असर पड़ता है? जवाब: सर्दियों में बहुत गर्म पानी से शरीर का तापमान तेजी से बढ़ जाता है। गर्म पानी से शरीर में वैसोडिलेशन प्रक्रिया होती है। इसका मतलब है कि ब्लड वेसल्स फैलती हैं। इससे ब्लड फ्लो बढ़ जाता है और हार्ट रेट तेज हो जाती है। नहाने के बाद जब शरीर ठंडी हवा में आता है तो शरीर में वैसोकॉन्ट्रिक्शन होता है। इसका मतलब है कि ब्लड वेसल्स सिकुड़ जाती हैं, जिससे ब्लड प्रेशर अचानक बढ़ सकता है। यह उन लोगों के लिए खतरनाक हो सकता है, जिनका पहले से दिल से जुड़ी बीमारियां है। सवाल: क्या गर्म पानी से नहाने से बुढ़ापा जल्दी आता है? जवाब: हां, बहुत गर्म पानी से नहाने से स्किन एजिंग तेज हो सकती है। गर्म पानी त्वचा की नेचुरल ऑयल लेयर को हटा देता है, जिससे स्किन की नमी और लचीलापन खत्म हो जाता है। इसके कारण त्वचा में झुर्रियां, रूखापन और डलनेस दिखने लगती है। लगातार गर्म पानी से नहाने पर झुर्रियां बढ़ सकती हैं और स्किन का इलास्टिन और कोलेजन कमजोर हो जाता है, जो बुढ़ापे के संकेत बढ़ाता है। जिन लोगों की स्किन संवेदनशील है, उन्हें एलर्जी या रैशेज का सामना करना पड़ सकता है। इसलिए सर्दियों में नहाने के लिए हल्का गुनगुना पानी इस्तेमाल करना बेहतर और सुरक्षित होता है। सवाल: गर्म पानी से नहाने से बाल क्यों झड़ने लगते हैं? जवाब: गर्म पानी से नहाने पर स्कैल्प का नेचुरल ऑयल खत्म हो जाता है। ये ऑयल बालों को मॉइश्चराइज और मजबूत रखता है। ये तेल खत्म होने पर स्कैल्प रूखा हो जाता है और बाल कमजोर होकर टूटने या झड़ने लगते हैं। बार-बार गर्म पानी से नहाने से बालों की जड़ें कमजोर हो जाती हैं और हेल्थी ग्रोथ रुक सकती है। सवाल: सर्दियों में नहाने के लिए पानी का सुरक्षित तापमान कितना होना चाहिए? जवाब: सर्दियों में नहाने के लिए पानी का सुरक्षित तापमान बहुत जरूरी है। इन दिनों में न तो बहुत ठंडे पानी से नहाना ठीक है और न ही बहुत गर्म पानी से नहाना अच्छा है। ठंडा पानी शरीर को अचानक शॉक देता है। इससे ब्लड प्रेशर, हार्ट रेट और इम्यून सिस्टम पर असर डाल सकता है। बहुत गर्म पानी से स्किन की नेचुरल ऑयल लेयर खत्म हो जाती है, बाल कमजोर हो जाते हैं और हार्ट रेट असामान्य रूप से बढ़ सकता है। यहां सामान्य पानी का मतलब ये नहीं कि टंकी या ड्रम में कई घंटों से रखे हुए पानी से नहा रहे हैं। यह सर्दियों में बर्फ जैसा ठंडा हो जाता है। इसका ये मतलब भी नहीं है कि उबलते पानी से भाप छोड़ते हुए नहा रहे हैं। सुरक्षित तरीका है, रनिंग वॉटर यानी ताजा पानी, जिसका तापमान शरीर आराम से सहन कर सकता है। इससे स्किन, बाल और हार्ट सभी सुरक्षित रहते हैं और नहाने का अनुभव भी आरामदायक होता है। सवाल: ठंड में नहाने के हेल्दी तरीके क्या हैं? जवाब: सर्दियों में स्वस्थ तरीके से नहाना है तो हल्का गुनगुना पानी लें। इसमें बहुत देर तक नहीं नहाना है। 5-10 मिनट में नहाकर टॉवेल से बदन को अच्छे से पोछ लें। इसके बाद तुरंत मॉइश्चराइजर लगाएं। सवाल: जिनकी स्किन ड्राई है, उन्हें किन बातों का ध्यान रखना चाहिए? जवाब: जिनकी स्किन ड्राई है, उन्हें नहाने के लिए ताजा पानी या गुनगुना पानी इस्तेमाल करना चाहिए। बहुत गर्म पानी से स्किन का नेचुरल ऑयल खत्म हो जाता है और ड्राइनेस बढ़ जाती है। शॉवर 5-10 मिनट तक ही लें, ज्यादा देर पानी में रहने से भी त्वचा की नमी खत्म हो जाती है। मुलायम, हाइड्रेटिंग क्लेंजर का इस्तेमाल करें। हार्श साबुन स्किन को और रूखा कर सकते हैं। ……………… ये खबर भी पढ़िए जरूरत की खबर- सर्दियों में बढ़ती आई ड्राईनेस: आंखों को नुकसान पहुंचाने वाली 5 गलतियां, ऑप्थेल्मोलॉजिस्ट से जानें 9 सेफ्टी टिप्स 43वें कॉन्ग्रेस ऑफ द यूरोपियन सोसाइटी ऑफ कैटरेक्ट एंड रिफ्रैक्टिव सर्जन्स (ESCRS) में एक स्टडी पेश की गई। इसके मुताबिक, अमेरिका और यूरोप में 50% से ज्यादा लोग ड्राई आई की समस्या से परेशान हैं। पूरी खबर पढ़िए...

"पेरेंटिंग- मेरे बच्चे बहुत झगड़ा करते हैं: टीवी रिमोट, खिलौने जैसी चीजों पर भिड़ जाते हैं, उन्हें प्यार से रहना कैसे सिखाऊं1:56","सवाल: मैं दिल्ली से हूं। मेरे दो बच्चे हैं। एक 10 साल का बेटा और 7 साल की बेटी। दोनों के बीच अक्सर झगड़े होते रहते हैं। कभी टीवी रिमोट को लेकर, कभी खिलौनों के लिए तो कभी मम्मी-पापा का अटेंशन किसे ज्यादा मिल रहा है, इसी बात पर बहस शुरू हो जाती है। छोटी-सी बात भी देखते-देखते झगड़े में बदल जाती है। अक्सर मुझे बीच-बचाव करना पड़ता है, लेकिन कई बार ऐसा होता है कि दोनों मुझसे ही नाराज हो जाते हैं। डांटने या समझाने पर कुछ देर के लिए शांति रहती है, मगर थोड़ी ही देर बाद फिर वही लड़ाई शुरू हो जाती है। कभी-कभी लगता है कि यह सिर्फ बच्चों के बीच की सामान्य तकरार है, लेकिन कई बार झगड़े इतने बढ़ जाते हैं कि घर का माहौल तनावपूर्ण हो जाता है। ऐसे में मुझे समझ नहीं आता कि इसे सामान्य ‘सिबलिंग राइवलरी’ मानूं या फिर किसी गहरी समस्या का संकेत। मैं चाहती हूं कि दोनों में आपसी समझ, टीमवर्क और प्यार भरा रिश्ता बने। कृपया बताएं कि क्या यह सामान्य है। मैं बतौर मां किस तरह का व्यवहार अपनाऊं ताकि दोनों बच्चों में सहयोग और संतुलन की भावना विकसित हो? एक्सपर्ट: डॉ. अमिता श्रृंगी, साइकोलॉजिस्ट, फैमिली एंड चाइल्ड काउंसलर, जयपुर जवाब- मैं आपकी चिंता को समझ सकती हूं। सिबलिंग्स के बीच झगड़े अक्सर पेरेंट्स के लिए भावनात्मक रूप से थका देने वाला अनुभव होता है। लेकिन सबसे पहले ये समझिए कि सिबलिंग राइवलरी यानी भाई-बहनों के बीच कंपटीशन और झगड़ा बचपन का हिस्सा है। अमेरिकन साइकोलॉजिकल एसोसिएशन (APA) के अनुसार, लगभग 70–80% बच्चे सिबलिंग राइवलरी का अनुभव करते हैं। यह उनके विकास और सोशल बिहेवियर का स्वाभाविक हिस्सा है। हालांकि जब यह रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी को प्रभावित करने लगे या झगड़े हिंसक रूप लें तो इस पर गंभीरता से ध्यान देना जरूरी है। सिबलिंग राइवलरी के कारणों को करें आइडेंटिफाई सिबलिंग्स के बीच झगड़ों के पीछे इनसिक्योरिटी, अटेंशन पाने की चाहत या घर के माहौल का असर समेत कई कारण हो सकते हैं। ऐसे में इसका हल निकालने से पहले कारणों को समझना जरूरी है। आइए, इन पॉइंट्स को समझते हैं। पेरेंट्स के अटेंशन की चाहत यह सबसे आम कारण है। हर बच्चा चाहता है कि माता-पिता उसे ज्यादा प्यार करें। जब उसे लगता है कि दूसरे भाई या बहन को ज्यादा अटेंशन मिल रही है (भले ही ऐसा न हो) तो वे इसके लिए झगड़ा शुरू कर देते हैं। भावनाओं को व्यक्त न कर पाना छोटे बच्चे अक्सर अपनी निराशा, ईर्ष्या या थकान को शब्दों में बयां नहीं कर पाते हैं। इसलिए वे अपनी भड़ास मारने, छीनने या रोने के रूप में निकालते हैं। थकान या भूख से चिड़चिड़ापन कई बार झगड़े का असली कारण बहुत साधारण होता है, जैसे- स्कूल से थककर आना, भूख लगना या नींद पूरी न होना। इस स्थिति में बच्चों का खुद पर कंट्रोल कम हो जाता है और वे छोटी-छोटी बातों पर भड़क जाते हैं। पक्षपातपूर्ण व्यवहार कई बार माता-पिता अनजाने में ही एक बच्चे का पक्ष लेते दिखते हैं। जैसे ‘तुम बड़े हो, तुम्हें समझदारी दिखानी चाहिए’ या ‘वह छोटी है, उसे दे दो।’ यह दोनों बच्चों के मन में नाराजगी भर देता है। बड़े बच्चे को लगता है कि उस पर हमेशा जिम्मेदारी डाली जाती है और छोटे को लगता है कि उसे 'छोटा' समझकर गंभीरता से नहीं लिया जाता। घर में तनावपूर्ण माहौल बच्चे 'स्पंज' की तरह होते हैं। अगर घर में माता-पिता के बीच तनाव है या काम का स्ट्रेस है तो बच्चे उस तनाव को महसूस करते हैं। उसे अपने भाई-बहन पर झगड़कर निकालते हैं क्योंकि वही उनके लिए सबसे 'सेफ टारगेट' होते हैं। प्रॉब्लम सॉल्विंग स्किल की कमी बच्चों को यह नहीं पता होता कि अगर दो लोगों को एक ही चीज चाहिए तो उसका हल कैसे निकाला जाए। उनके पास सिर्फ दो ही तरीके होते हैं, या तो लड़कर छीन लो या रोकर बड़ों से शिकायत कर दो। सिबलिंग राइवलरी सामान्य है या समस्या? ज्यादातर मामलों में यह बच्चों के लिए एक डेवलपमेंटल फेज यानी विकास की सामान्य प्रक्रिया होती है। कई स्टडीज बताती हैं कि ज्यादातर सिबलिंग्स बचपन में झगड़ते हैं, लेकिन किशोरावस्था तक ये अपने आप धीरे-धीरे कम हो जाती है। हालांकि अगर झगड़े रोजाना हों, ये बच्चों के मूड, नींद या स्कूल पर असर डालें या वे एक-दूसरे से दूरी बनाने लगें तो इसे हल्के में न लें। यह संकेत है कि बच्चों को अपनी भावनाएं कंट्रोल करने या साझा करने में मदद की जरूरत है। इसके लिए कुछ संकेतों को बिल्कुल भी इग्नोर नहीं करना चाहिए। सिबलिंग राइवलरी का बच्चों और परिवार पर असर इसका असर बच्चों की इमोशनल और सोशल ग्रोथ पर पड़ता है।नेशनल इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ चाइल्ड हेल्थ एंड ह्यूमन डेवलपमेंट (NICHD) की रिसर्च के अनुसार, अनसुलझे झगड़े बच्चों में एंग्जाइटी, लो कॉन्फिडेंस और कमजोर सोशल स्किल्स का कारण बन सकते हैं। लंबे समय में इससे भाई-बहनों के बीच का बॉन्ड कमजोर हो जाता है और परिवार का माहौल भी थकाऊ बन जाता है। सिबलिंग राइवलरी को सुलझाने के तरीके अक्सर माता-पिता गुस्से में आकर बच्चों को डांटते या सजा देते हैं। इससे अस्थायी शांति तो आती है, लेकिन यह समस्या का समाधान नहीं होता है। डर या दबाव से बच्चे झगड़ा बंद कर देते हैं, लेकिन उनसे यह नहीं सीख पाते कि मतभेद को कैसे सुलझाना है। इसलिए जरूरी है कि आप उन्हें सहयोग, बातचीत और टीमवर्क की दिशा में गाइड करें। इसके लिए कुछ बातों का खास ख्याल रखें। बच्चों को कॉन्फ्लिक्ट रिजॉल्यूशन सिखाना जरूरी साल 2002 में जर्नल ऑफ पीस साइकोलॉजी में एक स्टडी पब्लिश हुई। इसके मुताबिक, अमेरिका के पेंसिल्वेनिया के स्कूलों में क्लास 2 से 10 तक के बच्चों को कॉन्फ्लिक्ट रेजोल्यूशन प्रोग्राम में शामिल किया गया। छुट्टियों के बाद जब पेरेंट्स से बच्चों के व्यवहार पर फीडबैक लिया गया तो ज्यादातर ने बताया कि घर में छोटे-छोटे झगड़े कम हुए हैं। एक बच्चे ने तो कहा कि दादा-दादी को भी ये प्रोग्राम अटेंड करना चाहिए। जबकि एक बच्ची ने अपनी बिल्ली के झगड़े को शांत कराने की कोशिश की। यह दिखाता है कि बच्चों को कॉन्फ्लिक्ट रिजॉल्यूशन या प्रॉब्लम सॉल्विंग स्किल सिखाना बहुत जरूरी है। इससे उनमें समझ और सहानुभूति विकसित होती है। पेरेंट्स इन गलतियों से बचें कई बार माता-पिता अनजाने में झगड़े और बढ़ा देते हैं। जैसे एक बच्चे को फेवर करना या तुरंत फैसला थोप देना। इससे जलन और दूरी दोनों बढ़ती है। ऐसे में पेरेंट्स को कुछ गलतियों से बचना चाहिए। अंत में मैं यही कहूंगी कि सिबलिंग राइवलरी एक चुनौती जरूर है, लेकिन यह बच्चों को एक-दूसरे का सबसे बड़ा सपोर्टर बनाने का एक अवसर भी है। आप दिल्ली में हैं, आपके पास कई संसाधन उपलब्ध हैं। आप अपने बच्चों को ऐसी एक्टिविटीज या वर्कशॉप्स में डाल सकती हैं, जहां उन्हें टीमवर्क करने का मौका मिले। कई प्लेग्रुप्स या हॉबी क्लासेज इस पर फोकस करती हैं। याद रखें आपका लक्ष्य 'झगड़ा-मुक्त' घर बनाना नहीं, बल्कि एक ऐसा घर बनाना होना चाहिए, जहां मतभेदों को सम्मान और समझ के साथ सुलझाया जाता हो। इसमें समय लगेगा, लेकिन आपका धैर्य, आपका शांत व्यवहार और आपके लगातार प्रयास ही बच्चों के रिश्ते की नींव को मजबूत करेंगे। ............................. पेरेंटिंग से जुड़ी ये खबर भी पढ़िए पेरेंटिंग- 5 साल का बेटा रात में सोता नहीं: 12 बजे तक जागता रहता है, दिख रही थकान, चिड़चिड़ाहट, उसका स्लीप साइकल कैसे सुधारें इस उम्र में बच्चे फिजिकली और मेंटली दोनों रूप से बहुत तेजी से ग्रोथ कर रहे होते हैं। पर्याप्त नींद न मिलने से बच्चे के मूड, अटेंशन और इम्यून सिस्टम पर नेगेटिव प्रभाव पड़ता है। इस समस्या के समाधान को जानने से पहले इसके कारणों को आइडेंटिफाई करें। पूरी खबर पढ़िए...

"बुक रिव्यू- जिंदगी बदलनी है तो पहले खुद को बदलें: शुरुआत करें सेल्फ हेल्प के साथ, मदद के 8 तरीके ये किताब आपको सिखाएगी1:11","किताब का नाम: ‘सेल्फ हेल्प: आपके हाथ में जीवन की कुंजी’ (‘सेल्फ हेल्प: दिस इज योर चांस टू चेंज योर लाइफ’ का हिंदी अनुवाद) लेखक: गैब्रिएल बर्नस्टीन प्रकाशक: पेंगुइन अनुवाद: अपूर्व कृष्ण मूल्य: 350 रुपए हमें अपने जीवन में कई बार ऐसा महसूस होता है कि हमारी पुरानी आदतें, नकारात्मक सोच और डर भीतर ही भीतर हमें जकड़े हुए हैं। कभी अचानक गुस्सा फूट पड़ता है, कभी खुद पर शक होने लगता है तो कभी दूसरों को खुश करने की कोशिश में हम खुद को ही खो देते हैं। अक्सर ये पैटर्न हमारे बचपन की इनसिक्योरिटी, शर्म या डर से पैदा होते हैं और धीरे-धीरे हमारी पहचान का हिस्सा बन जाते हैं। लेकिन क्या हो जब हम इन डर और शर्म को दबाने के बजाय उन्हें पहचानें, स्वीकार करें और प्यार से ठीक करना शुरू करें? मशहूर अमेरिकी मोटिवेशनल स्पीकर और राइटर गैब्रिएल बर्नस्टीन की किताब ‘सेल्फ हेल्प: आपके हाथ में जीवन की कुंजी’ इसी बदलाव की दिशा दिखाती है। गैब्रिएल बर्नस्टीन को ‘गैबी’ के नाम से जाना जाता है। ये एक स्पिरिचुअल लीडर हैं, जिनकी किताबें लाखों लोगों को प्रेरित करती हैं। न्यूयॉर्क टाइम्स बेस्टसेलर लिस्ट में अपनी जगह बनाने वाली बर्नस्टीन योग, मेडिटेशन और आध्यात्मिकता पर बेस्ड किताबें लिखती हैं। अपनी इस किताब में उन्होंने इंटरनल फैमिली सिस्टम्स (IFS) थेरेपी के बारे में बताया है। IFS एक प्रमाणित थेरेपी है, जिसमें मन को अलग-अलग हिस्सों की तरह देखा जाता है। जैसे ‘इनर चाइल्ड’, ‘क्रिटिक’ व ‘प्रोटेक्टर’। इन हिस्सों को समझकर यह थेरेपी हमारे भीतर मौजूद असली, शांत और संतुलित ‘सेल्फ’ को एक्टिव करने में मदद करती है। गैबी की किताब थेरपिस्ट के ऑफिस से बाहर निकलकर रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी में फिट होती है। ये न सिर्फ प्रेरणा देती है, बल्कि व्यावहारिक प्रोसेस सिखाती है, जिससे आप खुद अपने हीलर बन सकते हैं। किताब का मकसद और अहमियत किताब का मकसद IFS के जटिल सिद्धांतों को सरल तरीके से समझाना है, ताकि हर कोई अपने आंतरिक संघर्षों को सुलझा सके। ये किताब बताती है कि कैसे एक्सट्रीम पैटर्न्स जैसे एडिक्शन, गुस्सा, खुद को खुश करने की कोशिश या लगातार सेल्फ-जजमेंट असल में पुराने डर को दबाने के तरीके हैं। जब हम इन्हें पहचान लेते हैं और इन हिस्सों को प्यार देते हैं तो हीलिंग तेज होती है। गैबी अपनी जिंदगी के अनुभव भी शेयर करती हैं। ये किताब स्पिरिचुअलिटी और साइंस को जोड़ते हुए समझाती है कि हमारे भीतर का ‘सेल्फ’ एक भरोसेमंद गाइडेंस सिस्टम की तरह काम करता है। नीचे दिए गए ग्राफिक में किताब की 8 मुख्य क्वालिटीज बताई गई हैं, जो सेल्फ एनर्जी की पहचान मानी जाती हैं। आइए इन सेल्फ हेल्प क्वालिटीज के बारे में विस्तार से बात करते हैं। जिज्ञासा: खुद को समझें हमारा मन कई ‘भागों’ से बना होता है। जैसे इनर चाइल्ड (जो डरता है), क्रिटिक (जो लगातार जज करता है)। गैबी बताती हैं कि ये हिस्से हमें बचाने की कोशिश तो करते हैं, लेकिन पुरानी यादों और पुराने डर के आधार पर अक्सर गलत दिशा दिखा देते हैं। इसलिए इन्हें जिज्ञासा के साथ समझना जरूरी है। उदाहरण के लिए, अगर आप अचानक गुस्सा हो जाएं तो रुककर पूछें कि ‘यह पार्ट मुझे किससे बचाने की कोशिश कर रहा है?’ यही क्यूरियोसिटी हमें जजमेंट से दूर रखती है और हीलिंग की शुरुआत करती है। यह प्रक्रिया धीरे-धीरे अंदर की शांति और सेल्फ एनर्जी को एक्टिव करती है। शांति और जुड़ाव: आंतरिक संघर्ष सुलझाएं गैबी बताती हैं कि IFS को रोजमर्रा की जिंदगी में लागू करके हम समझ सकते हैं कि एडिक्शन, ओवर-प्रोडक्टिविटी या लोगों को खुश करने की कोशिश जैसे पैटर्न अक्सर पुराने शेम को दबाने के तरीके होते हैं। इन हिस्सों को उसी तरह ध्यान से सुनें, जैसे किसी दोस्त को सुनते हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, अगर आप खुद को बार-बार दोष देते हैं तो रुककर पूछें कि ‘यह क्रिटिक वाला हिस्सा किस डर से एक्टिव हो रहा है? शायद यह बचपन की किसी असफलता से डर रहा है।’ इस तरह का जेंटल चेक-इन आपको अपने भीतर से जोड़ता है और क्लैरिटी लाता है। किताब में गैबी बताती हैं कि असली हीलिंग प्यार और स्वीकार्यता से होती है। स्पष्टता और करुणा: नेगेटिव स्टोरीज से मुक्ति ‘मैं कभी सफल नहीं हो पाऊंगा’ जैसी नेगेटिव बातों को दोहराना बंद करें और ‘चूज अगेन’ मेथड अपनाएं। नेगेटिव थॉट को पहचानें, गहरी सांस लें और उसकी जगह एक पॉजिटिव विकल्प चुनें। जैसे ’मैं सीख रहा हूं।’ उदाहरण के लिए, अगर जॉब रिजेक्शन से शेम महसूस हो तो खुद से कहें कि ’यह दर्द जायज है, लेकिन यह पूरी सच्चाई नहीं।’ यह प्रैक्टिस कहीं भी, कभी भी की जा सकती है। किताब बताती है कि ऐसे छोटे-छोटे मेटल शिफ्ट्स समय के साथ चमत्कारिक बदलाव लाते हैं। क्रिएटिविटी और साहस: वल्नरेबिलिटी को अपनाएं गैबी वल्नरेबिलिटी को कमजोरी नहीं, बल्कि एक बड़ी ताकत मानती हैं। उनका कहना है कि अपने डर और इनसिक्योरिटी को स्वीकार करना गहरे और सच्चे कनेक्शन बनाने का पहला कदम है। उदाहरण के लिए, अगर किसी रिश्ते में डर महसूस हो तो उसे क्रिएटिव तरीके से व्यक्त करें और साहस के साथ उस डर को चुनौती दें। यही ओपेननेस धीरे-धीरे हीलिंग और रिश्तों काे मजबूती देती है। आत्मविश्वास: सपोर्टिव एनवायर्नमेंट बनाएं गैबी कहती हैं कि आत्मविश्वास बढ़ाने के लिए पॉजिटिव लोगों के बीच रहना बेहद जरूरी है। उदाहरण के तौर पर, आप किसी सपोर्ट ग्रुप से जुड़ सकते हैं या अपने भरोसेमंद दोस्तों से अपनी भावनाएं शेयर कर सकते हैं। यह अकाउंटबिलिटी बढ़ाता है और आपको स्थिर बनाए रखता है। किताब में माइंडफुलनेस, अफर्मेशंस जैसे कई प्रैक्टिकल टूल्स दिए गए हैं, जिन्हें फिटनेस, करियर या रिलेशनशिप जैसे किसी भी क्षेत्र में लागू किया जा सकता है। इससे नेगेटिविटी कम होती है और भीतर की सेल्फ एनर्जी एक्टिव होने लगती है। यह किताब किसे पढ़नी चाहिए? अगर आप पुराने पैटर्न्स से तंग हैं और खुद को हील करना चाहते हैं तो ये किताब आपके लिए है। ये नए रीडर्स से लेकर IFS एक्सपर्ट्स तक सबके लिए है। किताब से क्या सीख मिलती है? ये किताब सिखाती है कि ट्रांसफॉर्मेशन रोज लिए जाने वाले छोटे-छोटे फैसलों का नतीजा है। IFS से हम समझते हैं कि हमारे दिमाग के अलग-अलग हिस्से हमें बचाने की कोशिश करते हैं, लेकिन असली गाइड हमारी सेल्फ एनर्जी होती है। चूज अगेन मेथड नेगेटिव थॉट्स को धीरे से शिफ्ट करता है। गैबी की व्यक्तिगत कहानियां जैसे ‘अपनी आंतरिक हीलिंग’ दिखाती है कि सेल्फ-कंपैशन ही ग्रोथ का ईंधन है। किताब याद दिलाती है कि हीलिंग परफेक्शन नहीं, बल्कि इंटीग्रेशन की प्रक्रिया है और आपके भीतर ही स्टार्टिंग पॉइंट और सॉल्यूशन दोनों है। कुल मिलाकर किताब यह समझाती है कि असली हीलिंग प्यार, जिज्ञासा और माफी से आगे बढ़ती है। किताब के बारे में मेरी राय मुझे ये किताब इसलिए पसंद आई क्योंकि ये स्पिरिचुअलिटी को ग्राउंडेड बनाती है। IFS का साइंटिफिक बेस जैसे ब्रेन के प्रोटेक्टिव पार्ट्स ने मुझे कन्विंस किया। गैबी की राइटिंग स्टाइल बहुत सरल और सहज है। कुछ जगहों पर रिपीटिशन की शिकायत है, लेकिन अगर आप IFS में इंटरेस्टेड हैं या सेल्फ-कंपैशन सीखना चाहते हैं तो ये पढ़ें। ये किताब न सिर्फ पढ़ने लायक, बल्कि लाइफ-लॉन्ग प्रैक्टिस है। गैबी हमें बताती हैं कि बदलाव हमेशा पॉसिबल है, बस इसके लिए खुद को पहचानें। .................... ये बुक रिव्यू भी पढ़िए बुक रिव्यू- जिंदगी के पांच सबसे कीमती धन: पैसा, रिश्ता, स्वास्थ्य, दिमाग और आर्थिक आजादी, इस संपदा को कैसे बचाएं और बढ़ाएं 'द 5 टाइप्स ऑफ वेल्थ' एक ऐसी किताब है जो आपको बताती है कि जिंदगी में असली खुशी सिर्फ पैसे से नहीं आती। लेखक साहिल ब्लूम कहते हैं कि हमें बचपन से ही सिखाया जाता है कि धन मतलब सिर्फ बैंक बैलेंस। जबकि सच तो ये है कि एक सच्ची अमीर जिंदगी इन पांच तरह के धन से बनती है- टाइम वेल्थ, सोशल वेल्थ, मेंटल वेल्थ, फिजिकल वेल्थ और फाइनेंशियल वेल्थ। पूरा रिव्यू पढ़िए...

"ग्राउंड रिपोर्ट11 बार विधायक-सांसद रहे आजम खान अब कैदी नंबर 425: 50 महीने जेल, 55 दिन बेल, फिर जेल; रामपुर के लोग बोले- योगी रहम करें3:49","17 नवंबर 2025, दोपहर का वक्त, पुलिसवाले यूपी के पूर्व मंत्री आजम खान और उनके बेटे अब्दुल्ला को रामपुर के MP-MLA कोर्ट से जिला जेल ले जा रहे थे। पुलिस की गाड़ी से उतरकर आजम जेल के मेन गेट पर उतरे, तो मीडिया ने घेर लिया। हाथ में चश्मे का केस और बिस्किट आजम से पूछा गया- फर्जी पैन कार्ड मामले में आपको 7 साल की सजा हुई है, क्या कहना चाहते हैं? जवाब में आजम इतना ही कह पाए- 'बेहतर है। कोर्ट ने गुनहगार समझा, तो सजा सुनाई है।' आजम के इस जवाब में उनकी बेबसी साफ दिखी। आजम 5 साल में 50 महीने जेल में रहे। रामपुर के लोग भी कहते हैं कि अब किसी नए मामले में आजम खान के जेल जाने पर हैरानी नहीं होती, फिर भी CM योगी आदित्यनाथ को उन पर रहम करना चाहिए। आजम पर फर्जी डॉक्यूमेंट देने, जमीन कब्जाने और हेट स्पीच के 104 केस दर्ज हुए, इनमें 11 में फैसला आ चुका है। 6 मामलों में सजा हुई, 5 में बरी हो गए। 2 महीने पहले 23 सितंबर को आजम जमानत पर सीतापुर जेल से बाहर आए थे। 55 दिन तक घरवालों के साथ रहे। अब फर्जी पैन कार्ड मामले में फिर से जेल पहुंच गए हैं। आजम और उनके बेटे अब्दुल्ला रामपुर जेल की बैरक नंबर 1 में कैद हैं। यहां आजम की पहचान कैदी नंबर 425 की है। ये बैरक उनके घर से सिर्फ 200 मीटर दूर है। ये फासला सिर्फ इतना है कि उनके मोहल्ले की मस्जिद में नमाज होती है, तो उसकी आवाज उन्हें सुनाई देती है। एक FIR, जिसने आजम को फिर सलाखों के पीछे पहुंचाया 17 नवंबर को फर्जी पैनकार्ड से जुड़े 2 मामलों में आजम और अब्दुल्ला पेशी पर MP-MLA कोर्ट पहुंचे थे। तब तक ये तय नहीं था कि उन्हें सजा मिल जाएगी। ये मामला दिसंबर 2019 में सामने आया था, जब BJP नेता आकाश सक्सेना ने आजम-अब्दुल्ला के खिलाफ FIR दर्ज करवाई थी। 6 साल तक लगातार जांच और सुनवाई चलती रही। आकाश सक्सेना अब रामपुर के विधायक हैं। सुनवाई के दिन कोर्ट में मौजूद थे। जज शोभित बंसल के सामने बहस शुरू हुई। सुनवाई के दौरान आकाश सक्सेना ने आरोप लगाया कि अब्दुल्ला आजम के साथ उनके पिता आजम खान भी दोषी हैं। 2017 में अखिलेश सरकार में नगर विकास मंत्री रहते हुए आजम ने रसूख के दम पर लखनऊ नगर निगम से बेटे का फर्जी बर्थ सर्टिफिकेट बनवाया। उसी के आधार पर फर्जी पैन कार्ड बनवाकर अब्दुल्ला को चुनाव लड़वाया। कोर्ट में पेश सबूतों के मुताबिक, अब्दुल्ला आजम ने दो अलग-अलग जन्म तिथियों के आधार पर दो पैन कार्ड बनवाए। एक पैन कार्ड में डेट ऑफ बर्थ 1 जनवरी 1993 थी, जबकि दूसरे में 30 सितंबर 1990 दर्ज कराई गई। ऐसे में अब्दुल्ला अपनी असली जन्मतिथि के हिसाब से 2017 के विधानसभा चुनाव में 25 साल की न्यूनतम उम्र पूरी नहीं करते थे। बावजूद इसके चुनाव लड़वाने के लिए आजम ने उनका दूसरा पैन कार्ड बनवाया। कोर्ट ने आजम और अब्दुल्ला को धोखाधड़ी और आपराधिक साजिश की धाराओं में दोषी माना। 7 साल की सजा और 50 हजार रुपए का जुर्माना लगाया। इसके बाद पुलिस ने कोर्ट रूम में ही सपा नेता और उनके बेटे को हिरासत में ले लिया। BJP विधायक बोले- सपा सरकार में सुनवाई नहीं हुई BJP विधायक आकाश सक्सेना कहते हैं, ‘आजम खान और उनके परिवार ने सत्ता में रहते हुए बहुत गलत काम किए। कानून ताक पर रखकर हमेशा फायदा उठाने की कोशिश की। इसका नतीजा आज उन्हें भुगतना पड़ रहा है। 2017 में आजम खान ने बेटे का नामांकन दाखिल करवाया, तभी हमने उनके खिलाफ शिकायत की थी, लेकिन उस समय सपा सरकार होने की वजह से किसी ने नहीं सुनी।’ सच्चाई सामने होते हुए भी हर चीज को छिपाया गया। बावजूद इसके हमने हार नहीं मानी। हमने RTI के जरिए सबूत इकट्ठा किए और कानूनी तरीके से 2019 में आजम खान और अब्दुल्ला के खिलाफ शिकायत दर्ज करवाई। आकाश आगे कहते हैं, ‘आजम खान को बेवजह जेल नहीं हुई। चाहे जौहर यूनिवर्सिटी के लिए रामपुर के लोगों की जमीनें कब्जाना हो या बेटे को चुनाव लड़वाने के लिए फर्जी दस्तावेज बनवाना, उन पर दर्ज सभी मुकदमे उनके निजी फायदे के लिए थे। सबको पता था कि इसका अंत जेल ही होने वाला था।’ लोग बोले- बुरे वक्त में अखिलेश ने साथ छोड़ा रामपुर के शाहबाद गेट पर बेकरी की दुकान चलाने वाले जाहिद हिंदुस्तानी कहते हैं, ‘आजम खान की उम्र 75 साल है। इस हिसाब से तो उनका राजनीतिक करियर खत्म हो चुका है। सक्रिय राजनीति करना भी उनके दायरे से बाहर है।' 'अखिलेश यादव चाहते तो आजम खान को परेशानियां न झेलनी पड़तीं। उन्होंने भी बुरे वक्त में साथ छोड़ दिया। अब जितना जीवन उनके पास बचा है, उन्हें परेशान नहीं किया जाना चाहिए।’ आजम खान के घर के पास जेल रोड पर रहने वाले फुकरान की फुटवेयर की दुकान है। वे कहते हैं, ‘आजम साहब गरीबों के नेता हैं। उन्होंने मंत्री रहते हुए पक्की सड़कों से लेकर बाजार और यूनिवर्सिटी बनवाई। बीड़ी मजदूरों के साथ बैठकर खाना खाते थे। अब सरकार बदल चुकी है, अपनी ताकत दिखा रही है।’ आजम खान के बंद पड़े रामपुर पब्लिक स्कूल के पास रेहड़ी लगाने वाले नसीम, फुकरान और जाहिद से अलग बात कहते हैं। उनके मुताबिक, आजम को जो सजा मिली, वे इसके हकदार थे। उन्होंने सत्ता में रहते हुए यहां की चीनी मिल बंद करवा दी। गरीब के बच्चों को बेरोजगार भटकने के लिए छोड़ दिया। उनकी वजह से मुसलमान सड़क पर आ गए। ऊपर वाला सब देखता है। उन्हें उनके किए की सजा मिल रही है। 2027 तक चुनाव नहीं लड़ सकते आजम और अब्दुल्ला यूपी सरकार में कभी कैबिनेट मंत्री रहे आजम ने बीते 5 साल में 50 महीने जेल में काटे। योगी सरकार आने के बाद 2 बार जेल गए। पहली बार फरवरी 2020 से मई 2022 तक और फिर अक्टूबर 2023 से सितंबर 2025 तक जेल में रहे। भड़काऊ भाषण के मामले में 2022 में आजम को सजा हुई और उनकी विधायकी चली गई। 2023 में अब्दुल्ला को भी जेल जाना पड़ा। उनकी भी विधायकी चली गई। अब फर्जी पैनकार्ड केस में बाप-बेटे 7 साल जेल की सजा काट रहे हैं। दोनों कानूनी तौर पर 2027 का चुनाव भी नहीं लड़ सकते हैं। ऐसे में बड़ा सवाल उठता है कि लगातार हो रही सजा के बाद क्या आजम का पॉलिटिकल करियर खतरे में है। रामपुर के सीनियर जर्नलिस्ट तमकीन फयाज खान कहते हैं, ‘आजम खान सिर्फ रामपुर के नहीं, पूरे यूपी के बड़े सियासी चेहरे रहे हैं। अब उन्हें जिस तरह सजाएं मिल रही हैं, ये कहना गलत नहीं होगा कि इसमें सियासत का दखल नहीं है। ये भी सच है कि कानून और अदालतें सबूत देखती हैं, तो फैसले भी उसी हिसाब से लिए जा रहे हैं।’ ‘जेल से रिहा होने के बाद भी वे शांत नहीं बैठे। वे लंबे वक्त के बाद जमानत पर घर आए थे। उन्हें खुद को संभालना चाहिए था, सेहत पर ध्यान देना चाहिए था, लेकिन सियासत ने कभी उनका साथ नहीं छोड़ा। वे बयानों को लेकर चर्चा में बने रहे। आजम इस कदर पॉलिटिक्स में घुस गए कि सपा नेता और रामपुर के सांसद मोहिबुल्लाह नदवी ने उनके खिलाफ मोर्चा खोल दिया।’ तमकीन के मुताबिक, आजम 9 बार विधायक, 2 बार सांसद रहे, 4 बार यूपी सरकार में मंत्री रहे। जाहिर है कि अब उन्हें इतना बड़ा पद फिर से मिल पाना मुश्किल है। बड़ा पॉलिटिकल फिगर होने के बावजूद उन पर जो मुकदमे और पुलिस कार्रवाई हुई, उससे न तो संसद बचा पाई और न ही उनकी विधायकी का लंबा रिकॉर्ड काम आया।' 'यहां तक कि सपा भी उनके सपोर्ट में कभी खुलकर खड़ी नहीं दिखी। उनके लिए अब यही अच्छा रहेगा कि वो सियासत छोड़ सेहत और यूनिवर्सिटी पर ध्यान दें।' रिश्तेदार बोले- सरकार नहीं चाहती आजम चैन से रहें 23 सितंबर को सीतापुर जेल से रिहा होकर आजम खान रामपुर पहुंचे थे। उनके घर पर मिलने वालों का हुजूम लगने लगा। नेता-विधायक से लेकर समर्थक मकान के बाहर घंटों खड़े रहते। अब सब गायब हैं। आजम की पत्नी तंजीन फातिमा और बड़ा बेटा अदीब केस से जुड़ी कानूनी प्रक्रिया देख रहे हैं। हम उनसे बात करने पहुंचे। वहां हमें बताया कि तंजीम की सेहत ठीक नहीं है और अदीब रामपुर से बाहर हैं। हमने बताए गए फोन नंबरों पर दोनों से संपर्क किया, लेकिन रिस्पॉन्स नहीं मिला। जवाब आने पर रिपोर्ट में अपडेट किया जाएगा। आजम और अब्दुल्ला के जेल जाने पर उनके करीबी रिश्तेदार और सपा नेता आसिम खान कहते हैं, ‘जब हुकूमत ही नहीं चाहती कि आजम चैन से रहें, तो क्या किया जा सकता है। अपील भी आप हैं, दलील और वकील भी आप के हैं, तो जो मनमर्जी आए वो कीजिए, जिसे चाहे हलाल कह दीजिए, जिसे चाहे हराम कह दीजिए।’ क्या 2017 के बाद से टारगेट पर हैं आजम आजम के समर्थकों का मानना है कि 2017 के बाद से आजम खान और उनकी फैमिली को टारगेट किया जा रहा है। आजम ने कभी सीधे तौर पर मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ के खिलाफ कोई टिप्पणी नहीं की, लेकिन वे हमेशा उन पर हावी रहे हैं। हालांकि रामपुर के इतिहास और आजम की पॉलिटिक्स पर करीब से नजर रखने वाले पॉलिटिकल एनालिस्ट विवेक गुप्ता इस बात से इत्तफाक नहीं रखते। विवेक कहते हैं, ‘अखिलेश सरकार में आजम के नाम का सिक्का चलता था। लखनऊ में विधानसभा चलती थी, तब हर रोज एक हेलिकॉप्टर उन्हें रामपुर छोड़ने आता था। दिसंबर 2017 की वो तस्वीर कोई कैसे भूल सकता है, जिसमें आजम और योगी हाथ पकड़कर विधानसभा की गैलरी में चल रहे थे।' 'CM योगी के लिए आजम खान कभी भी बड़ी चुनौती नहीं रहे। योगी हमेशा से हिंदू फायर ब्रांड चेहरा रहे हैं और आजम मुसलमानों के नेता। दोनों एक-दूसरे की राजनीति को पसंद नहीं करते।’ ‘आजम और अब्दुल्ला 2029 तक कोई चुनाव नहीं लड़ सकते। उनकी पत्नी तंजीम लंबे समय से राजनीति से दूर हैं। बड़े बेटे अदीब को पॉलिटिक्स में रुचि नहीं है। उनकी बहू सिदरा खान भविष्य में चुनाव लडेंगी या नहीं, ये कोई नहीं जानता। इसे देखते हुए यही लगता है कि आजम और उनके परिवार का पॉलिटिकल फ्यूचर गहरे संकट से गुजर रहा है।’ ........................................ ये खबर भी पढ़ें आजम खान के पास कितनी संपत्ति बची कभी यूपी सरकार में सबसे ताकतवर मंत्री रहे आजम खान योगी सरकार आने के बाद 2 बार जेल गए। कैद में रहते हुए आजम की करोड़ों की प्रॉपर्टी पर बुलडोजर चला। हमसफर रिसॉर्ट से लेकर उनके ड्रीम प्रोजेक्ट जौहर यूनिवर्सिटी में हॉस्टल घोटाला सामने आने पर बड़ी बदनामी हुई। रामपुर में आजम पर दर्ज किए गए 90 मामलों में अकेले 30

"कोहली ने डी-कॉक के आउट होने पर डांस किया: तिलक ने छलांग लगाकर सिक्स बचाया, हैट्रिक चौके लगाने के बाद रोहित आउट; मोमेंट्स0:58","साउथ अफ्रीका ने भारत को दूसरे वनडे में 4 विकेट से हरा दिया। रायपुर में बुधवार को मेहमान टीम ने 359 रन का टारगेट 49.2 ओवर में 6 विकेट खोकर हासिल कर लिया। टीम से ऐडन मार्करम ने सेंचुरी लगाई। बुधवार को क्विंटन डी कॉक के आउट होते ही विराट कोहली ने मैदान में डांस किया। ऐडन मार्करम के शॉट पर बाउंड्री पर खड़े तिलक वर्मा ने हवा में छलांग लगाकर सिक्स को बचा लिया। दूसरी ओर रोहित शर्मा ने नांद्रे बर्गर के ओवर में लगातार तीन चौके लगाए, लेकिन उसी ओवर में अगली गेंद पर वे आउट भी हो गए। पढ़िए IND vs SA दूसरे वनडे के टॉप-10 मोमेंट्स... 1. कोहली, जायसवाल और ऋतुराज ने बाउंड्री से खाता खोला यशस्वी जायसवाल, विराट कोहली और ऋतुराज गायकवाड ने अपनी पारी का पहला रन बाउंड्री से बनाया। ओपनर यशस्वी ने मैच की पहली ही गेंद पर चौका लगाया। नांद्रे बर्गर की गेंद पर उन्होंने ड्राइव शॉट खेला और पॉइंट की दिशा में चौका जड़ दिया। विराट कोहली ने छठे ओवर की आखिरी गेंद पर सिक्स लगाया। लुंगी एनगिडी की शॉर्ट गेंद पर उन्होंने पुल शॉट खेलकर बॉल को फाइन लेग के बाहर भेजा। जायसवाल के आउट होने के बाद क्रीज पर आए ऋतुराज गायकवाड ने भी चौके से शुरुआत की। उन्होंने नौवें ओवर में मार्को यानसन की गेंद पर बाउंड्री लगाई। 2. हैट्रिक चौके लगाने के बाद रोहित आउट नांद्रे बर्गर के ओवर में रोहित शर्मा ने लगातार तीन गेंद पर तीन चौके लगाए। पहली गेंद 144 किमी प्रति घंटे की थी, जिस पर रोहित ने हल्के हाथों से खेला और गेंद स्लिप और शॉर्ट थर्ड मैन के बीच से निकलकर बाउंड्री तक गई। अगली गेंद सीधी और फुल थी, जिसे रोहित ने मिडविकेट की ओर चौके के लिए भेज दिया। तीसरी गेंद ऑफ स्टंप के बाहर फुलर लेंथ की थी। रोहित ने शॉट खेला और बॉल बैकवर्ड पॉइंट के बाहर बाउंड्री के लिए चली गई। इसी ओवर की पांचवीं गेंद पर रोहित क्रीज से खेलते हुए डिफेंस करने गए और गेंद उनके बैट के बाहर के किनारे से लग गई। क्विंटन डी कॉक ने कैच पकड़ते ही तुरंत रिएक्ट किया और गेंद हवा में उछाल दी। बर्गर की ओर से ज्यादा अपील नहीं हुई, लेकिन डी कॉक ने कप्तान बावुमा को रिव्यू लेने के लिए कहा। अल्ट्रा-एज में साफ दिखा कि गेंद बैट से लगी थी। रिव्यू सफल रहा और साउथ अफ्रीका को विकेट मिला। रोहित का स्कोर 8 गेंद में 14 रन रहा, जिसमें तीन चौके शामिल थे। 3. दर्शक मैदान में आया, कोहली के पैर छुए विराट कोहली की फिफ्टी के बाद एक फैन सिक्योरिटी तोड़कर मैदान में घुस आया और कोहली के पैर छू लिए। बाद में सिक्योरिटी गार्ड उसे बाहर ले के गए। रायपुर में पहले वनडे के दौरान भी एक फैन कोहली की सेंचुरी के बाद उनके पैर छुने के लिए मैदान में घुस आया था। 4. गायकवाड ने चौके से पहला शतक लगाया 34वें ओवर में ऋतुराज गायकवाड ने अपना पहला वनडे शतक चौका लगाकर पूरा किया। उन्होंने 52 गेंद में अपना अर्द्धशतक पूरा किया और इसके बाद तेजी से खेलते हुए 77 गेंद में शतक लगा दिया। शतक पूरा होते ही कोहली ने उन्हें गले लगाया। गायकवाड ने हेलमेट उतारकर बल्ला उठाया और दर्शकों का अभिवादन किया। यह शतक कॉर्बिन बॉश की फुल गेंद पर आया, जिसे उन्होंने मिड-ऑन के पास से चौके के लिए भेज दिया। 5. सुंदर रन आउट हुए वाशिंगटन सुंदर 41वें ओवर की आखिरी गेंद पर रन आउट हो गए। मार्करम की गेंद ऑफ स्टंप के पास थी, जिसे सुंदर ने रिवर्स स्वीप करने की कोशिश की, लेकिन गेंद बैट के किनारे से लगकर सीधा शॉर्ट थर्ड मैन पर चली गई। यह राहुल का कॉल था, लेकिन सुंदर बिना देखे रन के लिए निकल पड़े। राहुल ने शुरुआत से ही रन लेने में दिलचस्पी नहीं दिखाई। सुंदर को बीच में रुककर वापस लौटना पड़ा और उन्होंने डाइव भी लगाई, लेकिन तब तक देर हो चुकी थी। बॉश ने स्लाइड करते हुए गेंद रोकी और तुरंत डी-कॉक की ओर थ्रो फेंका। डी-कॉक ने गिल्लियां बिखेर दीं और अंपायर रॉड टकर ने बिना रिव्यू के सुंदर को आउट दे दिया। सुंदर 8 गेंद में 1 रन बनाकर रन आउट हुए। 6. ब्रीट्जकी ने राहुल का कैच छोड़ा मार्को यानसन के 46वें ओवर में मैथ्यू ब्रीट्जकी ने राहुल का आसान कैच छोड़ दिया। ओवर की चौथी गेंद ऑफ स्टंप के बाहर थी और राहुल ने बैट का फेस खोलकर पॉइंट के ऊपर से शॉट खेला। ब्रीट्जकी समय पर पहुंच गए थे और दोनों हाथों से कैच लेने की कोशिश भी की, लेकिन गेंद उनकी कलाई पर लगी और निकल गई। 7. टी-20 वर्ल्ड कप के लिए इंडिया की जर्सी लॉन्च पहली इनिंग के बाद BCCI ने 7 फरवरी से शुरू होने वाले टी-20 वर्ल्ड कप के लिए टीम इंडिया की नई जर्सी भी लॉन्च कर दी। रायपुर में सेक्रेटरी देवजीत सैकिया की मौजूदगी में जर्सी लॉन्च हुई। इस दौरान टी-20 टीम के तिलक वर्मा और टूर्नामेंट के ब्रांड एम्बेसडर रोहित शर्मा भी मौजूद रहे। 8. भारत ने पहले ही ओवर में रिव्यू गंवाया भारतीय टीम ने पहले ही ओवर में एक रिव्यू गंवा दिया। अर्शदीप सिंह की तीसरी बॉल ऐडन मार्करम के स्टंप के करीब से निकली। कॉट बिहाइंट की अपील को फील्ड अंपायर ने खारिज किया। ऐसे में भारतीय कप्तान ने रिव्यू की मांग की थी। लेकिन अंपायर का फैसला बरकरार रहा। 9. डी कॉक के आउट होने के बाद कोहली का डांस अर्शदीप सिंह ने 4.5 ओवर में क्विंटन डी कॉक को आउट करके भारत को पहला विकेट दिलाया। फुल लेंथ गेंद पिच के बाद बाहर की ओर हल्की मूव हुई। डी-कॉक मिड-ऑन के ऊपर से शॉट खेलने गए, लेकिन गेंद उनके बैट के किनारे से लगकर हवा में काफी ऊंची चली गई। मिड-ऑन पर वॉशिंगटन सुंदर दाई ओर दौड़े और कैच ले लिया। डी-कॉक के आउट होते ही कोहली ने डांस कर दिया। क्विंटन 11 गेंद में 8 रन बनाकर आउट हुए, जिसमें दो चौके शामिल थे। 10. तिलक ने हवा में छलांग लगाकर सिक्स बचाया 20वें ओवर में कुलदीप यादव की गेंद पर मार्करम ने बड़ा शॉट खेलने की कोशिश की, लेकिन गेंद ठीक से बैट पर नहीं आई। लॉन्ग-ऑन पर खड़े तिलक वर्मा मौके पर पहुंच गए। उन्होंने हवा में उछलकर शानदार कैच पकड़ा, लेकिन देखते ही समझ गए कि गिरते समय उनका कदम बाउंड्री लाइन के बाहर पड़ सकता है। इस समय तिलक ने हवा में ही गेंद छोड़ दी। इस तरह उन्होंने भारत

"वित्तमंत्री ने हिंदी में बोला, TMC सांसद ने आपत्ति जताई: कहा- मैं बंगाली, कैसे समझूंगा; निर्मला का जवाब- मैं हिंदी या तमिल बोलूं, आपको दिक्कत क्या1:30","शीतकालीन सत्र के दौरान गुरुवार को लोकसभा में वित्त मंत्री निर्मला सीतारमण के हिंदी बोलने पर विवाद हुआ। वित्तमंत्री 'हेल्थ सिक्योरिटी से नेशनल सिक्योरिटी सेस बिल' के बारे में बात कर रहीं थीं। उन्होंने बिल के फायदे हिंदी में बताए। इस बीच भाषण को टोकते हुए TMC सांसद सौगत रॉय उठे और आपत्ति जताई। उन्होंने स्पीकर जगदंबिका पाल की तरफ इशारा करके कहा कि, निर्मला जी ने हिंदी में बात की। मैं उनकी बात समझ नहीं पाया क्योंकि हम बंगाली हैं। इस पर जगदंबिका पाल ने सौगत से कहा कि सदन की कार्यवाही कई भाषाओं में उपलब्ध है। आप इसे देख सकते हैं। इसके बाद वित्तमंत्री ने भी जवाब देते हुए कहा कि वे तमिल में बोलें या हिंदी-अंग्रेजी में, माननीय सदस्य को दिक्कत क्या है। वित्तमंत्री ऑफिस की तरफ से इस विवाद का पूरा वीडियो सोशल मीडिया X पर शेयर किया गया। 3 तस्वीरें में घटनाक्रम... विवाद को सिलसिलेवार पढ़िए... सौगत रॉय: निर्मला जी ने भी हिंदी में बात की। मैं उनकी बात समझ नहीं पाया क्योंकि हम बंगाली हैं। हम हिंदी को ज्यादा नहीं समझते। स्पीकर जगदंबिका पाल: सदन की कार्यवाही कई भाषाओं में उपलब्ध है। यह पहले से ही पार्लियामेंट ऐप पर है। आप इसे देख सकते हैं। सौगत रॉय: हम बंगाली हैं, और हम बंगाली ही रहेंगे। स्पीकर जगदंबिका पाल: आप बंगाली हैं, लेकिन आप हिंदी को लेकर इस तरह से बात नहीं कर सकते। निर्मला सीतारमण: मैं हिंदी में बोल सकती हूं, मैं तमिल में बोल सकती हूं, मैं तेलुगु में बोल सकती हूं, मैं इंग्लिश में बोल सकती हूं। माननीय सदस्य को इससे क्या फर्क पड़ता है? वह अपनी पसंद की किसी भी भाषा में ट्रांसलेशन करवा सकते हैं। यह सबकुछ बिल से ध्यान भटकाने की कोशिश है। उन्होंने बिल को अच्छी तरह से नहीं पढ़ा है, और क्योंकि वह टॉपिक से भटकाना चाहते हैं, इसलिए वह ये सब बातें ला रहे हैं। मुझे इस पर एतराज है, और इसे रिकॉर्ड में होना चाहिए। भाषा को लेकर देश में पिछले विवाद 21 नवंबर: उदयनिधि स्टालिन बोले- संस्कृत मरी हुई भाषा, अब हिंदी क्यों थोप रहे तमिलनाडु के डिप्टी CM उदयनिधि स्टालिन ने 21 नवंबर को संस्कृत भाषा को लेकर विवादित बयान दिया था। उन्होंने कहा था कि एक तरफ पीएम ऐसे दिखा रहे हैं जैसे उन्हें तमिल भाषा की परवाह है, दूसरी तरफ वे हिंदी और संस्कृत थोपने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं। जब आप तमिल सीखने के लिए इतने बेताब हैं, तो बच्चों को हिंदी और संस्कृत क्यों पढ़ा रहे हैं? संस्कृत मरी हुई भाषा है। 19 फरवरी: केंद्र लैंग्वेज वॉर शुरू न करे, जो हिंदी अपनाते हैं, वे मातृभाषा खो देते हैं तमिलनाडु के डिप्टी सीएम उदयनिधि ने 19 फरवरी को कहा था कि जो राज्य हिंदी को स्वीकार करते हैं, वे अपनी मातृभाषा खो देते हैं। केंद्र लैंग्वेज वॉर शुरू न करें। इस बयान के बाद राज्य में सत्तारूढ़ DMK और बीजेपी के बीच केंद्र की ट्राई लैंग्वेज नीति और हिंदी को थोपने को लेकर बहस तेज हो गई है। 12 मार्च: जल्द बच्चे पैदा करें और उनके नाम तमिल में रखें, हिंदी में नहीं तमिलनाडु के मुख्यमंत्री एमके स्टालिन के बाद उनके बेटे उदयनिधि स्टालिन ने राज्य के लोगों से जल्द से जल्द बच्चे पैदा करने की अपील की है। साथ ही बच्चों के नाम हिंदी के बजाय तमिल में रखने को कहा है। उदयनिधि ने कहा- हमने राज्य की जनसंख्या नियंत्रित की लेकिन अब हमें इससे समस्या हो रही है। -------------------- यह खबर भी पढ़ें... दिल्ली पुलिस ने बांग्ला को बांग्लादेशी भाषा कहा: TMC सांसद अभिषेक बनर्जी बोले- ये गलती नहीं, साजिश है दिल्ली पुलिस ने 29 जुलाई को बंग भवन को लिखे एक सरकारी लेटर में बांग्ला भाषा को बांग्लादेशी भाषा बताया। इसमें लिखा था, 'अवैध रूप से भारत में रह रहे 8 बांग्लादेशी नागरिकों को गिरफ्तार किया है। इनके पास से बरामद डॉक्यूमेंट्स बांग्लादेशी भाषा में हैं। ऐसे में आगे की जांच के लिए बांग्लादेशी राष्ट्रीय भाषा का एक आधिकारिक अनुवादक उपलब्ध कराएं।' पूरी खबर पढ़ें...

"सुषमा स्वराज के पति स्वराज कौशल का निधन: ​​​​​​​देश के सबसे युवा राज्यपाल बने थे, राज्यसभा सांसद भी रहे; आज दिल्ली में अंतिम संस्कार","पूर्व विदेश मंत्री सुषमा स्वराज के पति और भाजपा सांसद बांसुरी स्वराज के पिता स्वराज कौशल का गुरुवार को निधन हो गया। दिल्ली भाजपा ने X पोस्ट में उनके निधन की जानकारी दी है। दिल्ली भाजपा ने बताया कि स्वराज कौशल का 73 साल की उम्र में 4 दिसंबर को निधन हो गया। उनका अंतिम संस्कार आज लोधी रोड श्मशान घाट पर किया जाएगा। स्वराज कौशल देश के इतिहास में सबसे कम उम्र में राज्यपाल बनने वाले शख्स थे। 1990 में उन्हें मिजोरम का राज्यपाल बनाया गया था। उस वक्त उनकी उम्र महज 37 साल थी। इसके अलावा कौशल 1998 से 2004 तक हरियाणा से राज्यसभा सांसद भी रहे। सुप्रीम कोर्ट में सीनियर एडवोकेट रहे। इस दौरान उन्होंने कई हाई-प्रोफाइल केस लड़े। स्वराज कौशल के निधन से जुड़ी 2 फोटो... बेटी बांसुरी बोलीं- पिता का जाना हृदय की सबसे गहरी पीड़ा स्वराज कौशल की बेटी और भाजपा सांसद बांसुरी स्वराज ने X पर लिखा- पापा स्वराज कौशल जी, आपका स्नेह, आपका अनुशासन, आपकी सरलता, आपका राष्ट्रप्रेम और आपका अपार धैर्य मेरे जीवन की वह रोशनी हैं जो कभी मंद नहीं होगी। उन्होंने आगे लिखा- आपका जाना हृदय की सबसे गहरी पीड़ा बनकर उतरा है, पर मन यही विश्वास थामे हुए है कि आप अब मां के साथ फिर मिल चुके हैं, ईश्वर के सान्निध्य में, शाश्वत शांति में। आपकी बेटी होना मेरे जीवन का सबसे बड़ा गौरव है। आपकी विरासत, आपके मूल्य और आपका आशीर्वाद ही मेरी आगे की हर यात्रा का आधार रहेंगे। सुषमा और स्वराज की लव स्टोरी का किस्सा पढ़िए... दरअसल, देश के बंटवारे के वक्त लाहौर के धरमपुरा इलाके के रहने वाले हरदेव शर्मा और लक्ष्मी देवी हरियाणा के अंबाला के कैंट एरिया में रहने लगे थे। हरदेव RSS से जुड़े थे। 14 फरवरी 1952 को उनके घर सुषमा का जन्म हुआ। सुषमा शर्मा बचपन से मेधावी थीं। अंबाला में सनातन धर्म कॉलेज से संस्कृत और पॉलिटिकल साइंस में ग्रेजुएशन के बाद सुषमा ने चंडीगढ़ में पंजाब यूनिवर्सिटी से लॉ किया और राजनीति में आईं। इसी दौरान सुषमा शर्मा की मुलाकात स्वराज कौशल से हुई। ‘RSS के राष्ट्रवादी विचार’ वाली सुषमा और समाजवादी सोच के स्वराज कौशल के बीच दोस्ती हो गई। सुप्रीम कोर्ट में साथ में प्रैक्टिस करने के दौरान दोनों के बीच प्रेम का इजहार हुआ। ये इमरजेंसी का दौर था, सोशलिस्ट और पूर्व रक्षा मंत्री जॉर्ज फर्नाडिंस पर आरोप लगा था कि उन्होंने बड़ौदा में अवैध रूप से डायनामाइट रखा था। जॉर्ज आपातकाल के विरोध में थे, डायनामाइट केस के बहाने उन्हें जेल में बंद कर दिया गया। स्वराज और सुषमा जॉर्ज का केस लड़ने के लिए एक साथ कोर्ट जाया करते थे। शुरुआत में दोनों के घर वाले शादी के लिए तैयार नहीं थे। आखिरकार इमरजेंसी के बीच 13 जुलाई, 1975 को शादी हो गई। इमरजेंसी के बाद के आम चुनावों में जॉर्ज फर्नांडिस ने जेल से ही चुनाव लड़ने का ऐलान किया। सुषमा स्वराज ने बड़ौदा जाकर जॉर्ज फर्नांडिस की तरफ से पर्चा भरा और एक नारा दिया- ""जेल का फाटक टूटेगा, जॉर्ज हमारा छूटेगा।"" ये नारा बहुत मशहूर हुआ और जॉर्ज चुनाव जीत गए। सोर्स- गूगल ट्रेंड्स --------------------------------- ये खबर भी पढ़ें... 25 की उम्र में विधायक, 52 दिन की CM बनीं:सुषमा स्वराज रात में पुलिस स्टेशन पहुंच जातीं; जेल में सीखी कन्नड़ अक्टूबर 1998 का समय। दिल्ली की BJP की सरकार में CM की कुर्सी पर भयंकर खींचतान मची थी। एक तरफ थे पूर्व CM मदन लाल खुराना और दूसरी तरफ CM साहिब सिंह वर्मा। सुष्मिता दत्ता अपनी किताब 'सुषमा स्वराज: द पीपल्स मिनिस्टर्स' में लिखती हैं कि दोनों गुटों के कार्यकर्ता रोज भिड़ रहे थे। इससे धारणा बनी कि पार्टी दिल्ली पर शासन करने में समर्थ नहीं है। पूरी खबर पढ़ें...

वर्ल्ड अपडेट्स: दावा- फ्रांसी राष्ट्रपति बोले- यूक्रेन को धोखा दे सकता है अमेरिका; यूरोपीय नेताओं की सीक्रेट कॉल लीक,"फ्रांस के राष्ट्रपति इमैनुएल मैक्रों ने चेतावनी दी है कि अमेरिका, यूक्रेन को धोखा दे सकता है। जर्मन अखबार डेर श्पीगल के मुताबिक 1 दिसंबर को यूरोपीय नेताओं की एक सीक्रेट वीडियो कॉल लीक हो गई थी। जिसमें जर्मनी के चांसलर फेडरिक मर्ज, फ्रांस के राष्ट्रपति इमैनुएल मैक्रों, फिनलैंड के राष्ट्रपति अलेक्जेंडर स्टब, नाटो के महासचिव मार्क रूटे, पोलैंड के प्रधानमंत्री डोनाल्ड टस्क, इटली की प्रधानमंत्री जॉर्जिया मेलोनी और यूक्रेन के राष्ट्रपति वोलोडिमिर जेलेंस्की शामिल थे। इस दौरान मैक्रों ने शक जताया था कि अमेरिका बिना मजबूत सुरक्षा गारंटी दिए यूक्रेन को क्षेत्र छोड़ने के लिए मजबूर कर सकता है। इस कॉल की लिखित रिकॉर्डिंग अखबार के पास पहुंची है। नेताओं ने साफ कहा कि उन्हें अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प के दो खास लोगों अमेरिकी राजदूत स्टीव विटकॉफ और ट्रम्प के दामाद जेरेड कुशनर पर जरा भी भरोसा नहीं है। जर्मनी के चांसलर मर्ज ने जेलेंस्की से कहा, “आने वाले दिनों में बहुत सावधान रहिए, आपके साथ और हमारे साथ खेल खेला जा रहा है।” फिनलैंड के राष्ट्रपति स्टब और नाटो चीफ रूटे ने भी यही बात दोहराई कि जेलेंस्की को इन दोनों अमेरिकियों के साथ अकेला नहीं छोड़ा जा सकता। यूक्रेन के राष्ट्रपति कार्यालय ने इस पूरी खबर को झूठी और गलत जानकारी बताया है। अंतरराष्ट्रीय घटनाओं से जुड़ी अन्य बड़ी खबरें... बांग्लादेशी गाय तस्कर की BSF फायरिंग में मौत; अवैध तरीके से भारतीय सीमा में घुसा था भारत-बांग्लादेश बॉर्डर पर गुरुवार तड़के BSF की फायरिंग में एक बांग्लादेशी नागरिक की मौत हो गई। गाय तस्करी में शामिल में मृतक अवैध तरीके से भारतीय सीमा में घुसा था। मृतक का नाम सबुज मिया (30) है। बॉर्डर गार्ड बांग्लादेश (BGB) के मुताबिक 8 से 10 बांग्लादेशी तस्कर रात में अवैध रूप से भारतीय इलाके में घुसे थे। BSF की चेनाकाटा कैंप की पेट्रोल टीम ने उन्हें रोकने की कोशिश की। इसी दौरान BSF ने फायरिंग की, जिसमें सबुज मिया की मौत हो गई जबकि बाकी लोग भागकर बांग्लादेश लौट गए। घटना के बाद BSF शव अपने साथ ले गई। बांग्लादेश की बॉर्डर गार्ड (BGB) ने BSF से शव लौटाने के लिए फ्लैग मीटिंग की मांग की है। BGB अधिकारियों ने कहा कि उन्होंने संबंधित BSF कैंप को पत्र भेजकर शव की वापसी का आग्रह किया है। अमेरिकी शांति संस्थान का नाम 'ट्रम्प इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ पीस' हुआ; व्हाइट हाउस बोला- दुनिया में शांति लाएगा व्हाइट हाउस ने गुरुवार को बताया कि अमेरिकी शांति संस्थान (USIP) का नाम बदलकर 'डोनाल्ड जे. ट्रम्प इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ पीस' कर दिया गया है। यह बदलाव ठीक उस वक्त हुआ है, जब ट्रम्प गुरुवार को रवांडा के राष्ट्रपति पॉल कागामे और डेमोक्रेटिक रिपब्लिक ऑफ कांगो (डीआरसी) के राष्ट्रपति फेलिक्स तशिशेकेदी ​​​​​​ की मेजबानी करने वाले हैं। यहां अमेरिका की मदद से दोनों देशों के बीच शांति समझौतों पर हस्ताक्षर होंगे। व्हाइट हाउस ने कहा, ""अब यह डोनाल्ड जे. ट्रम्प इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ पीस कहलाएगा। यह नाम एक ऐसे राष्ट्रपति के सम्मान में है, जिन्होंने एक साल से आठ युद्ध खत्म किए। यह मजबूत नेतृत्व से दुनिया में शांति हासिल करने का प्रतीक बनेगा।"" अमेरिका H-1B वीजा के लिए अप्लाई करने वालों की कड़ी जांच करेगा, सोशल मीडिया मॉनिटरिंग से जुड़े लोगों पर खास नजर अमेरिकी स्टेट डिपार्टमेंट ने अपने सभी दूतावासों को निर्देश दिया है कि वे H-1B वीजा के लिए अप्लाई करने वालों की लिंक्डइन प्रोफाइल और उनके रिज्यूमे की डिटेल जांच करें। निर्देश के मुताबिक, अगर किसी इंसान ने किसी भी तरीके में अमेरिका में बोलने की आजादी (फ्री स्पीच) को कंट्रोल करने की कोशिश की है, तो उन्हें वीजा के लिए अयोग्य घोषित किया जा सकता है। H-1B वीजा अमेरिकी टेक कंपनियों के लिए बेहद खास है, क्योंकि इनमें बड़ी संख्या में लोग भारत और चीन से आते हैं। कई टेक इंडस्ट्री ने चुनाव के समय डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प का समर्थन किया था। उन्हें उम्मीद थी कि ट्रम्प सरकार ने व्यापार के लिए माहौल अनुकूल होगा। हालांकि अब कंपनियों को नए तरह की वीजा जांच का सामना करना होगा, जिसे ट्रम्प प्रशासन अमेरिका में अभिव्यक्ति की आजादी बचाने का कदम बता रहा है। दूतावासों को भेजे गए निर्देश में कहा गया है कि वीजा अधिकारी आवेदक और उनके परिवार के पेशे की जांच करें। खासकर उन लोगों की, जिन्होंने कंटेंट मॉडरेशन, मिस-इन्फॉर्मेशन मॉनिटरिंग, फैक्ट-चेकिंग, डिस-इन्फॉर्मेशन रिसर्च, ऑनलाइन सेफ्टी या कंप्लायंस जैसे क्षेत्रों में काम किया हो। अमेरिका का मानना है कि इन क्षेत्रों में काम करने वाले कुछ लोग ऐसा काम भी करते हैं जिसे वह 'कानूनी तौर पर फ्री स्पीच को कंट्रोल करना' मान सकते हैं। जर्मनी में इजराइली एयर डिफेंस सिस्टम 'एरो-3' तैनात, ये रूसी बैलिस्टिक मिसाइलें रोकने में सक्षम जर्मनी ने बर्लिन के पास इजराइल में बना एरो-3 एयर डिफेंस सिस्टम तैनात किया। मीडिया रिपोर्ट्स के मुताबिक यह रूस की ओरेशनिक जैसी बैलिस्टिक मिसाइलों का भी पता लगाकर उन्हें रोक सकता है। इजराइल ने हाल ही यह सिस्टम जर्मनी की राजधानी बर्लिन के पास स्थित एक एयर फोर्स बेस में आयोजित समारोह के दौरान जर्मनी को सौंपा था। इजराइली रक्षा मंत्रालय ने बताया कि यह उनके देश के इतिहास का सबसे बड़ा रक्षा निर्यात सौदा है। यह समझौता दो साल पहले लगभग 4 अरब डॉलर में हुआ था और 2025 तक सिस्टम देने का वादा किया गया था। एरो-3 इजराइल की सबसे एडवांस मिसाइल डिफेंस तकनीक है। यह लॉन्ग रेंज से आने वाली बैलिस्टिक मिसाइलों को स्पेस में ही तबाह करने की क्षमता रखता है। इजराइल ने पिछले दो सालों में ईरान और यमन से दागी गई कई मिसाइलों को इससे रोककर देश को सुरक्षित किया है। इजराइल एयरस्पेस इंडस्ट्रीज के चीफ ने कहा कि दुनिया में बैलिस्टिक मिसाइलों का खतरा बढ़ रहा है। ऐसे हालात में एरो-3 जैसी तकनीक बहुत अहम हो जाती है। उन्होंने बताया कि इजराइल ने हाल के सालों में सैकड़ों मिसाइलों को इसी सिस्टम की मदद से रोका है। जर्मनी और इजराइल पहले भी कई रक्षा सौदे कर चुके हैं। इजराइल ने जर्मनी से पनडुब्बियां और नौसेना के जहाज खरीदे हैं, जबकि जर्मनी ने इजराइल से टैंकों के लिए डिफेंस सिस्टम और एंटी-टैंक मिसाइलें ली हैं। अमेरिका के ओमाहा गैस स्टेशन पर युवक ने फायरिंग की, 3 पुलिसकर्मी घायल; हमलावर ढेर अमेरिका के ओमाहा शहर में एक गैस स्टेशन पर हुई गोलीबारी में तीन पुलिस अधिकारी घायल हो गए। पुलिस ने जवाबी फायरिंग में 20 साल के संदिग्ध को मार गिराया। घटना बुधवार दोपहर एक ग्रोसरी स्टोर में हुई फायरिंग के बाद शुरू हुई थी। ओमाहा पुलिस चीफ टॉड श्माडेरर ने बताया कि संदिग्ध ने दोपहर में एक ग्रोसरी स्टोर में 61 साल के शख्स को सीने में कई गोलियां मारीं। घटनास्थल से मिली लाइसेंस प्लेट जानकारी के आधार पर पुलिस ने संदिग्ध की कार का पीछा किया, जो एक गैस स्टेशन तक पहुंची। पुलिस के मुताबिक, संदिग्ध गैस स्टेशन में एक टॉयलेट कमरे में घुस गया। थोड़ी देर बाद वह बाहर निकला और अधिकारियों पर फायरिंग शुरू कर दी। गोली लगने से दो पुलिसकर्मी घायल हुए, जबकि एक अधिकारी को छर्रे लगे। जवाबी कार्रवाई में पुलिस ने संदिग्ध को मौके पर ही ढेर कर दिया। चीफ श्माडेरर ने कहा- ओमाहा के लिए यह बेहद खतरनाक दिन था और यह सब इसी संदिग्ध की वजह से हुआ। पुलिस ने बताया कि घायल अधिकारियों को स्थानीय अस्पताल ले जाया गया। उनकी चोटें जानलेवा नहीं हैं। छर्रे लगने वाले अधिकारी को बाद में अस्पताल से छुट्टी दे दी गई, जबकि अन्य दो की विस्तृत स्थिति अभी साफ नहीं है। हमास के हमले में 5 सैनिक घायल होने के बाद इजराइल ने दक्षिणी गाजा में एयरस्ट्राइक की इजराइली सेना ने बुधवार को दक्षिणी गाजा में हवाई हमला किया। यह कार्रवाई दिन में हुए हमास के उस हमले के जवाब में की गई, जिसमें पांच इजराइली सैनिक घायल हुए थे। बुधवार देर रात हुई ये एयरस्ट्राइक ऐसे समय में की गईं जब इजराइल और हमास दोनों ही सीजफायर उल्लंघन के आरोप एक-दूसरे पर लगा रहे हैं। अक्टूबर की शुरुआत से लागू यह समझौता कई बार तनाव में आया, लेकिन आंशिक रूप से जारी है। दिन में पहले इजराइली अधिकारियों ने कहा कि उन्हें गाजा में मौजूद आखिरी बंधकों में से एक के बॉडी पार्ट्स मिले हैं। इसके साथ ही इजराइल ने कुछ फिलिस्तीनी नागरिकों को मिस्र सीमा के जरिए क्षेत्र से बाहर जाने की अनुमति देने का फैसला भी किया। इजराइल का दावा है कि उसने एयरस्ट्राइक शुरू करने से पहले हमास द्वारा सीजफायर तोड़ने की कई घटनाओं को दर्ज किया है। स्थानीय स्वास्थ्य अधिकारियों के मुताबिक अक्टूबर के आखिरी हफ्ते में हुए हमलों में 104 लोगों की मौत हुई थी, जबकि नवंबर के अंत में 33 लोगों की जान गई थी। Copyright © 2024-25 DB Corp ltd., All Rights Reserved This website follows the DNPA Code of Ethics.",real,https://www.bhaskar.com,https://www.bhaskar.com/international/news/breaking-news-headlines-israel-gaza-us-trump-china-pakistan-russia-ukraine-136579426.html
"अमेरिका में F-16 फाइटर जेट क्रैश: कुछ सेकेंड पहले पायलट सुरक्षित निकला, इस साल 8वीं बार क्रैश हुआ F-161:00","अमेरिका में गुरुवार को US एयरफोर्स का एक F-16 लड़ाकू विमान क्रैश हो गया। हादसे से कुछ सेकेंड पहले पायलट सुरक्षित बाहर निकल गया, जिससे उसकी जान बच गई। हादसा भारतीय टाइम के मुताबिक रात करीब 12:30 बजे दक्षिणी कैलिफोर्निया में ट्रॉना शहर के एक रेगिस्तान में हुआ। विमान ट्रॉना एयरपोर्ट से करीब तीन किलोमीटर दूर गिरा। एयरपोर्ट मैनेजर ने बताया कि इस इलाके में अक्सर मिलिट्री विमान उड़ते रहते हैं। सोशल मीडिया पर आए वीडियो में देखा गया कि विमान तेजी से नीचे गिर रहा था और पायलट पैराशूट के सहारे बाहर निकल आया। जमीन से टकराते ही विमान में बड़ा धमाका हुआ और काला धुआं आसमान में भर गया। इस साल यह आठवीं बार है जब F-16 क्रैश हुआ है। सबसे ज्यादा 3 बार यूक्रेन, 2 बार अमेरिका के अलावा यह फाइटर जेट पोलैंड, जापान और साउथ कोरिया में क्रैश कर चुका है। हादसे से जुड़ीं 3 तस्वीर F-16 की कीमत 1.70 हजार करोड़ रुपए एयरफोर्स के 2021 के डेटा के मुताबिक एक F-16 फाइटिंग फाल्कन की कीमत लगभग 18.8 मिलियन डॉलर (करीब 1.70 हजार करोड़ रुपए) है। यह एयरक्राफ्ट थंडरबर्ड्स स्क्वाड्रन का था। यह टीम लास वेगास के पास नेलिस एयरफोर्स बेस से काम करती है और अपने एयर शो और खतरनाक स्टंट्स के लिए दुनियाभर में जानी जाती है। थंडरबर्ड्स टीम ने बताया कि ट्रेनिंग मिशन के दौरान पायलट विमान से सफलतापूर्वक बाहर निकल गया। पायलट को मामूली चोटें आईं और उसे अस्पताल में भर्ती कराया गया। लोकल फायर ब्रिगेड डिपार्टमेंट ने बताया कि घटनास्थल पर सिर्फ पायलट मौजूद था और आग से आसपास के इलाके को कोई खतरा नहीं है। क्रैश का कारण अभी साफ नहीं अधिकारियों के मुताबिक सुबह 6 थंडरबर्ड्स जेट ट्रेनिंग के लिए उड़े थे, लेकिन सिर्फ पांच ही लौटे। शुरुआती जानकारी के मुताबिक विमान चाइना लेक नेवल एयर वेपन्स स्टेशन के पास गिरा। यह रीजन मिलिट्री ट्रेनिंग के लिए अक्सर इस्तेमाल किया जाता है। थंडरबर्ड्स के एयर शो और ट्रेनिंग मिशन में F-16 फाइटिंग फाल्कन खास रोल निभाता है। एयरफोर्स की 57th विंग पब्लिक अफेयर्स ऑफिस के मुताबिक हादसे की जांच जारी है और क्रैश साइट की जांच पूरी होने के बाद और जानकारी शेयर की जाएगी। 25 से ज्यादा देश F-16 इस्तेमाल करते हैं F-16 अमेरिका का मल्टी-रोल फाइटर जेट है, जिसे 1970 के दशक में जनरल डायनामिक्स ने बनाया था। अब इसे अमेरिकी डिफेंस कंपनी लॉकहीड मार्टिन बनाती है। पाकिस्तान समेत 25 से ज्यादा देश F-16 इस्तेमाल करते हैं। F-16 ने 2 फरवरी 1974 को पहली बार उड़ान भरी थी। इसे 21 जुलाई 1980 को ""फाइटिंग फाल्कन"" का नाम दिया गया था। साल 1976 से अब तक 4,600 से भी ज्यादा F-16 जेट अलग-अलग देशों के लिए बनाए जा चुके हैं। F-16 की स्पीड 2414 किलोमीटर प्रति घंटा है। इसकी रेंज 4220 किलोमीटर तक है। इसमें एडवांस रडार सिस्टम है। साथ ही ये एडवांस हथियार से लैस होता है। ये फाइटर जेट हवा से हवा में मारने में सक्षम है। ये एक मिनट में करीब 50 हजार फीट की ऊंचाई तक जा सकता है। F-16 चौथी जनरेशन का लड़ाकू विमान है। ये खराब मौसम में भी उड़ान भर सकता है। 51 साल में 768 बार क्रैश हुआ F-16 F-16 ने पहली उड़ान 1974 में भरी थी, जिसके बाद ये अब तक करीब 750 बार क्रैश हो चुका है। ये लड़ाकू विमान कई देशों में इस्तेमाल होता है, इसलिए इसके साथ हादसे भी ज्यादा हुए हैं। अगस्त 2025 में पोलैंड में F-16 क्रैश हुआ था, जिसमें पायलट की मौत हो गई थी। इस साल आठ बार F-16 क्रैश कर चुका है। 2024 में सिंगापुर और ग्रीस के F-16 विमान टेकऑफ करते समय क्रैश हो गए थे, लेकिन पायलट सुरक्षित बाहर निकल गए थे। 2018 में अमेरिकी सेना के मेजर स्टीफन डेल बाग्नो ट्रेनिंग के दौरान स्प्लिट‑S स्टंट करते समय बेहोश होकर कंट्रोल खो बैठे थे। 2015 में स्पेन में F-16 क्रैश हुआ था, जिसमें दो पायलट और जमीन पर मौजूद कई लोग की मौत हो गई थी। 1982–1993 के बीच, सिर्फ अमेरिका में ही लगभग 200 से ज्यादा F-16 जेट्स क्रैश हुए थे। F-16 के सबसे बड़े हादसे युद्ध में नहीं, बल्कि ट्रेनिंग और स्टंट उड़ानों के दौरान हुए हैं। 1991 के गल्फ वॉर में F-16 का खास रोल था इराक ने अगस्त 1990 में कुवैत पर कब्जा कर लिया था, जिससे बाद गल्फ वॉर की शुरुआत हुई थी। इस दौरान F-16 ने सबसे अहम रोल निभाया था और हजारों मिशन पूरे किए थे। इसने दुश्मन के कई एयरफील्ड और राडार स्टेशन तबाह कर दिया थे। टैंक और अन्य हथियारों पर सटीक हमले किए थे। इसने अपनी उड़ानों से अन्य विमानों को सुरक्षा कवरेज भी दी थी। F-16 के हादसे क्यों होते रहते हैं 1. इंजन की खराबी F-16 जेट का इंजन कभी-कभी उड़ान के दौरान फेल हो जाता है, जिससे विमान कंट्रोल से बाहर हो सकता है। यह हादसों का सबसे बड़ा कारण माना जाता है, क्योंकि इंजन की खराबी के समय पायलट के पास बहुत कम समय बचता है। 2. पायलट की गलतियां कभी-कभी हादसे पायलट की गलती के कारण भी होते हैं। बहुत तेज स्पीड में छोटे-छोटे फैसले या गलत मोड़ लेना, एविएशन नियमों का पालन न करना या खतरे से बचने के दौरान गलती करना बड़ी दुर्घटना का कारण बन सकता है। 3. ट्रेनिंग और स्टंट उड़ानों का खतरा F-16 अक्सर एयर शो और ट्रेनिंग मिशन के दौरान बहुत तेज स्टंट और जटिल उड़ानें करता है। तेज स्पीड, अचानक मोड़, कम ऊंचाई और जोखिम भरे रूटीन की वजह से हादसे होने की संभावना बहुत बढ़ जाती है। 4. पुराने विमान और ज्यादा इस्तेमाल F-16 का पहला मॉडल 1970 के दशक में बनाया गया था और अब कई विमान काफी पुराने हो गए हैं। पुराने विमान के पार्ट्स घिस जाते हैं, इंजन कमजोर हो जाता है और रख-रखाव की जरूरत बढ़ जाती है। इन कारणों से दुर्घटनाओं का खतरा भी बढ़ जाता है। भारत को F-16 बेचना चाहता है अमेरिका अमेरिका साल 2000 से F-16 जेट्स भारत को बेचने की कोशिश कर रहा है, लेकिन भारत ने इन्हें खरीदने से इनकार कर दिया। इस एक वजह है पाकिस्तान में इनकी मौजूदगी। दरअसल, 1980 के दशक से यह लड़ाकू विमान पाकिस्तान के पास है। अमेरिका और पाकिस्तान की इस डील से भारत नाखुश है। इसलिए आज तक भारत ने अमेरिका से F-16 फाइटर जेट नहीं लिया है। --------------------- यह खबर भी पढ़ें... भारत का तेजस फाइटर जेट दुबई एयर शो में क्रैश:पायलट की भी मौत, हिमाचल प्रदेश के कांगड़ा के रहने वाले थे दुबई एयर शो में भारतीय

Putin says Russia disagrees with parts of US plan to end Ukraine warThe Russian leader's comments come as US and Ukrainian negotiators are due to hold a new round of talks.55 mins agoEurope,"President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow disagrees with parts of a US plan on how to end the Russia-Ukraine war, after talks with US negotiators in the Kremlin. ""At times we said that yes, we can discuss this, but to that we can't agree,"" Putin told India Today. He did not name the sticking points. At least two major points of contention remain - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine. President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, who led the US team at Tuesday's talks, is due to meet Ukraine's negotiators in Florida. Trump said the talks were ""reasonably good"", adding it was too soon to say what would happen as ""it does take two to tango."" In his India Today interview ahead of a state visit to Delhi, Putin said Moscow had not seen a modified version of the US peace plan before his nearly five-hour talks with Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. ""That's why we had to go over every point, that's why it took so long,"" Putin said. He again stressed that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from the country's eastern Donbas region - even from the areas still under their control. Russian forces now control some 85% of the Donbas. ""Either we take back these territories by force, or eventually Ukrainian troops withdraw,"" the Russian president said. Putin's senior foreign policy adviser and key negotiator Yuri Ushakov earlier said the Kremlin talks produced ""no compromise"" on ending the war. Ushakov also implied that the Russian negotiating position had been strengthened thanks to what Moscow said were its recent successes on the battlefield. When asked by a reporter on Wednesday if Witkoff and Kushner believed Putin wanted an end to the war, Trump said the Kremlin leader ""would like to end the war. That was their impression"". But Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhia accused Putin of ""wasting the world's time"", while Ukraine's ambassador to the US said they do not ""need to wait for promises from Russia"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has so far ruled out ceding any Ukrainian territory, insisting on firm security guarantees for Ukraine in any deal. On Wednesday, he said ""the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war"", but negotiations must be ""backed by pressure on Russia"", which Kyiv and its European allies accuse of deliberately stalling any ceasefire agreements. Zelensky earlier said his top negotiators had managed to make some key changes in the original US peace plan - seen as strongly favouring Moscow - during last week's talks with an American delegation in Geneva. In a joint statement, US and Ukrainian negotiators said they had drawn up an ""updated and refined peace framework"" - but provided no further details. Top negotiators from Europe - who had voiced concern over the original US plan - were also in the Swiss city, meeting separately with the Ukrainian and the US teams. In a separate development on Thursday, Germany's Der Spiegel news website said it had obtained a confidential transcript of a conference call in which European leaders expressed concern over the US negotiations. ""There is a possibility that the US will betray Ukraine on the issue of territory without clarity on security guarantees,"" French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said, according to an English transcript of Monday's conference call. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was quoted as warning that Zelensky had to be ""extremely careful in the coming days"". ""They are playing games, both with you and with us,"" Merz reportedly said. Finnish President Alexander Stubb was also quoted as saying: ""We mustn't leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys."" The BBC has not seen the reported transcript. In response to a Der Spiegel inquiry, France's Élysée Palace stated that ""the president did not express himself in those terms"". The presidential office declined to provide details on how Macron expressed himself, citing confidentiality. Stubb declined to comment to Der Spiegel, and Merz has not commented on the issue. The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. In recent weeks, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in south-east Ukraine, despite reported heavy combat casualties. Dawn Sturgess, 44, died in 2018 after coming into contact with the nerve agent Novichok. Rusia's ability to target a defector with nerve agent is almost certainly diminished but it may pose other threats, the BBC's security correspondent writes. The partnership aims to protect undersea cables, which Western officials say face increased threat from Moscow. An official report has concluded that Russian president Vladimir Putin was ""morally responsible"" for her death.

"Oil, defence and geopolitics: Why Putin is visiting Modi in DelhiBBC editors explain what is at stake as Russian President Vladimir Putin starts a two-day visit to India.3 hrs agoWorld","Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived for a two-day visit to India, where he was embraced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of an annual summit held by both countries. Delhi and Moscow are expected to sign a number of deals during the visit, which comes months after the US increased pressure on India to stop buying Russian oil. It also comes as US President Donald Trump's administration holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to end the war. India and Russia have been close allies for decades and Putin and Modi share a warm relationship. Here's a look at why they both need each other - and what to watch for as they meet. By Steve Rosenberg Why are relations with India key for the Kremlin? Well, for a start, look at the numbers: That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil. India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian. That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market. India was happy. Washington less so. Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying. For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems. Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers. But there's geopolitics at play, too. The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed. Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that. So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders smiling and chatting together sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a ""multi-polar world"". Russia lauds its ""no limits partnership"" with China. It is just as vocal about its ""special and privileged strategic partnership"" with India. That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union. ""I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,"" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov. ""We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France. It had a multi-vector policy. ""But now we are totally isolated from Europe. This is unprecedented. Our philosophers always said that Russia was a part of Europe. Now we're not. This is a big failure and a big loss. I'm sure that part of Russia's political and entrepreneurial class is dreaming of returning to Europe and of doing business not only with China and India."" This week, though, expect to hear about Russia-India friendship, trade deals and increased economic cooperation between Moscow and Delhi. By Vikas Pandey Putin's visit to Delhi is coming at a crucial time for Modi and India's global ambitions. India-Russia ties go back to the Soviet era and have endured irrespective of the changing geopolitical landscape. Putin has arguably put more time and energy into this relationship than other Russian leaders before him. As for Modi, despite coming under intense pressure from Western governments to criticise Russia over its war in Ukraine, he maintained that dialogue was the only way to resolve the conflict. This was India's ""strategic autonomy"" at play – with Modi occupying a particular place in the geopolitical order where he held close ties with Moscow while maintaining his relationship with the West at the same time. That worked - until Trump returned to the White House. India-US ties have hit an all-time low in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock. In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here. Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his ""true friend"". But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare joint article in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine. And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe. ""For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,"" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank. Modi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia. Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades. Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct. With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade. Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing. But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets. India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix. Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible. But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin. Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance. ""Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,"" GTRI said. Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy. He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West. ""Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,"" GTRI said. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.

Skip to content,"An 11-year old girl was found dead with more than 80 injury marks on her body in Surat. According to reports, she was raped and tortured before she was strangulated. This news came close on the heels of the public outrage over the Kathua and Unnao rape cases. It is now being claimed by some sections on social media that an ABVP activist is behind the rape and murder of this child. ABVP is the student organisation affiliated to the Sangh parivar. A website called www.dailygraph.in was one of the first to post this information on April 14. This article mentioned one Harish Thakur as responsible for the rape and murder. The article was later edited and this detail was removed. The message below has been posted on the Facebook page by the name of AIMIM which has more than 268,000 followers. It is a fan page and not the official page of AIMIM. This message which was posted on April 14 claims that Harish Thakur, an ABVP activist is responsible for the rape and murder of the 11-year old girl in Surat. At the time of writing, this post was shared more than 500 times. #JusticeForGudiya #GujaratModel आक थू हिन्दू राष्ट्र! एबीवीपी का नेता है हरीश ठाकुर 11 वर्ष की बच्ची को अगवा करके… Posted by Aimim on Saturday, April 14, 2018 On Twitter, this message was retweeted by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal which was pointed out by a Twitter user Gujju_er. The original tweet by the Twitter user @YUVAMARWADI that was retweeted by the Delhi CM was later deleted. Apart from Kejriwal, this message was also retweeted by AAP leaders Alka Lamba and Dilip Pandey, and RJD leader Misa Bharti. It was also posted on Facebook by the page Aam Aadmi Party- Deoria on April 14, and has been shared more than 5000 times. This claim that the rape and murder was the handiwork of an ABVP activist named Harish Thakur is false. This was confirmed by Surat police in a reply to a tweet by a user named Irfan Anjum who was among those who made this claim. Anjum has also been booked along with two others under Section 505(1) of the IPC for spreading rumours on social media. Moreover, Surat police in a tweet has solicited information from the public on the case. The tweet mentions that the body of the girl was found near the cricket ground in Surat on April 6, 2018. The police has sought information on the family of the girl and the perpetrator of the crime. दिनाक ०६/०४/२०१८ को सुरत शहेर मे क्रीकेट ग्राउन्ड के करीब एक लडकी की लाश मिली हे ,इस लडकी के परीवार के बारे मे या अपराधी के बारे मे कोइ भी जानकारी मीले तो सूरत शहर अपराध शाखा के नंबर 02612436024 पर या पांडेसरा थाना के नंबर 02612890200 पर संपर्क करे. इनाम प्रदान कीया जायेगा. pic.twitter.com/gjZGvemamx — Surat City Police (@CP_SuratCity) April 15, 2018 Alt News tried to establish the source of claims vis-a-vis Harish Thakur and stumbled upon an article by Amar Ujala dated March 19, 2018. This article had mentioned one Harish Thakur who is allegedly an ABVP worker as the accused in the rape and murder of a minor in Agra, which is probably the source of this misinformation. The incidents of Kathua and Unnao have resulted in an outpouring of anger against the ruling dispensation for the perceived laxity and lack of sensitivity in handling these cases. However, this does not justify spreading rumours on social media, as the police is still investigating the case and there is no information so far on the involvement of an ABVP activist in this horrific case from Surat.

Editorial Policy,"Alt News is committed to fact-checking in a fair, transparent and non-partisan manner. We strive for high editorial standards and adhere by the following guidelines: Nonpartisan approach: Alt News has no political affiliations. We believe in fact-checking news from all ends of the political spectrum and apply the same standards to claims irrespective of who originate them. We call out fake news without fear or favour. Evidence-backed: Facts are sacrosanct to a fact-checker. We therefore aim to be accurate in our fact-checking, consulting multiple sources to ensure that fact-checks are backed by sound evidence. Depending on the nature of fact-check required, we use internet tools like reverse image search or source data from official sources. Where necessary, we also reach out to the relevant person to verify a claim. We do not quote anonymous sources. Transparency: Alt News explains in detail how the claim was debunked. This is done in the interest of transparency and it also serves an educational purpose, guiding the readers how to evaluate claims which they may come across in future.",fake,https://www.altnews.in/fake-news/,https://www.altnews.in/editorial-policy/
Alt News Policy on Hate Speech,"After five years of extensive reportage of misinformation, Alt News launched UnHate in 2022. We believe that there is a pressing need for fixing accountability among all stakeholders (individuals, media outlets, advertisers, social media platforms, and others) who are directly or indirectly responsible for either publishing or amplifying hate speech. On November 3, Alt News officially published a preliminary policy document on hate speech. For the time being, the policy is based on the Facebook Community Standards on hate speech. In its reportage on hate speech, Alt News will refer to this document. This policy will be updated as we continue to report on hate speech. As per the United Nations, ‘In common language, “hate speech” refers to offensive discourse targeting a group or an individual based on inherent characteristics (such as race, religion or gender) and that may threaten social peace.’ However, the UN adds that ‘there is no universal definition of hate speech under international human rights law. The concept is still widely disputed, especially in relation to freedom of opinion and expression, non-discrimination and equality.’ To provide a unified framework for the United Nations to address the issue globally, the UN Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech defines hate speech as…’any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour, that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender or other identity factor.’ While the above is not a legal definition and is broader than ‘incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence’ – which is prohibited under international human rights law — it has three important attributes: Hate Speech can be defined as a direct attack against people – rather than concepts or institutions – on the basis of what we call protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and serious disease. We define attacks as violent or dehumanising speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt, disgust or dismissal, cursing and calls for exclusion or segregation. We also prohibit the use of harmful stereotypes, which we define as dehumanising comparisons that have historically been used to attack, intimidate or exclude specific groups, and that are often linked with offline violence. We consider age a protected characteristic when referenced along with another protected characteristic. We also protect refugees, migrants, immigrants and asylum seekers from the most severe attacks, though we do allow commentary and criticism of immigration policies. Similarly, we provide some protections for characteristics such as occupation, when they’re referenced along with a protected characteristic. Sometimes, based on local nuance, we consider certain words or phrases as frequently used proxies for PC groups.” Tier 1 Content targeting a person or group of people (including all groups except those who are considered non-protected groups described as having carried out violent crimes or sexual offences or representing less than half of a group) on the basis of their aforementioned protected characteristic(s) or immigration status with: Tier 2 Content targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their protected characteristic(s) with: Tier 3 Content targeting a person or group of people on the basis of their protected characteristic(s) with any of the following: Content that describes or negatively targets people with slurs, where slurs are defined as words that are inherently offensive and used as insulting labels for the above characteristics.",fake,https://www.altnews.in/fake-news/,https://www.altnews.in/alt-news-policy-on-hate-speech/
Methodology for fact checking,"Alt News continuously monitors social media and mainstream media for incorrect and/or dubious information. Our sources for topics include: Given the volume of fake claims that are circulating on any given day, Alt News makes a selection of which ones to debunk. The following parameters are considered for selection of topics we write on: Once a suspicious claim has been selected for a fact check, Alt News engages in systematic research to verify it. To debunk any fake claim, Alt News may use one or more of the below methodologies: Using a variety of tools and methods described above, Alt News evaluates the veracity of a claim and arrives at a conclusion. Where relevant, more than one tool is used to conclusively debunk the fake claim. Once the claim has been selected, researched and evaluated, Alt News puts out the information in public domain through articles that are detailed yet reader friendly. We strive to establish the context in which the particular claim was made, focus on simplicity of language, and provide links that debunk the claim so that readers can verify the information for themselves. If the information is inadequate or out of bounds, we refrain from passing conclusive judgement. Information is often dynamic, as a result of which stories have to be constantly updated. Alt News keeps an eye out for relevant news and updates its articles so as to provide readers with the latest and the most accurate information.

"Previous Story India Today circulates old videos of Kohli, Akshay Kumar as messages on Kathua & Unnao","On April 14, 2018, news channel India Today reported that Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli has expressed anguish over the Kathua and Unnao rape cases. Breaking this news on the channel, the anchor says, “In a video message, Kohli says the support for rape accused is really shameful. Listen in”. This is followed by a video of the cricketer in which he is purportedly expressing his views on the incident. Aaj Tak, India Today‘s Hindi counterpart, also broadcast this video message of Kohli as his reaction on the Kathua and Unnao incidents. This has also been reported by Times Now and Hindustan Times in their Hindi editions. This video message has been circulating on Facebook as well. The page Amethi Rae Bareli ki Kahani which has more than 600,000 followers uploaded this video on April 14 with the caption ‘Emotional Virat Kohli raises questions over Kathua rape case, says he is ashamed he is part of such a society’ (translated). This video has been shared more than 4000 times. “Akshay Kumar’s blood boils over Kathua rape case” (translated). With this caption, a video of the actor is circulating on social media in which he is expressing his anger and anguish over the gruesome incident of the rape and murder of the 8-year old victim in Kathua, Jammu. This video has been shared by News Tak, which is a mobile-friendly spin-off of India Today group, on its Facebook page. कठुआ रेप केस पर खौला अक्षय कुमार का खून | News Tak कठुआ रेप केस पर खौला अक्षय कुमार का खून | News Tak Posted by News Tak on Saturday, April 14, 2018 The above video was uploaded on April 14 and has been viewed almost 20 lakh times. More than 82,000 Facebook users have shared it at the time of writing. It turns out that these video messages by Virat Kohli and Akshay Kumar are NOT in relation to the incidents of Kathua and Unnao. They are in reference to the incident of molestation that took place in Bengaluru on New Year’s eve on December 31, 2016 which had resulted in outrage. It was in the backdrop of that incident that these videos has been posted by these celebrities, expressing anger and concern over the incident. NDTV had reported about this video message by Virat Kohli in January 2017. Similarly, Akshay Kumar’s message of January 2017 had been reported by India TV back then. Meanwhile, Akshay Kumar had tweeted about the Kathua case on April 12, calling for justice for the Kathua rape victim. Yet again we’ve failed as a society. Can’t think straight as more chilling details on little Asifa’s case emerge…her innocent face refuses to leave me. Justice must be served, hard and fast! https://t.co/xrW5RVffLe — Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) April 12, 2018 The outrage over the horrific incidents that took place in Kathua and Unnao is understandable, but what is not is the lack of due diligence on the part of the news channel which played old videos of two public figures that had originally been put out in the public domain in a different context. Even a casual perusal of their social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter would have made it amply clear that they haven’t posted any video on this issue.

Indian real estate firm Prestige Group has no connection with Hong Kong building that caught fire,"After the inferno at Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong’s Tai Po area claimed the lives of at least 151 people, an X account named RTSG News claimed that the firm responsible for the maintenance of the ill-fated project was Prestige Construction, owned by an Indian national, Irfan Razack. On November 26, 2025, seven out of eight phases of the Wang Fuk Court were engulfed in flames, marking Hong Kong’s deadliest fire in a decade. The blaze was fully extinguished by the morning of November 28, after around 40 hours of relentless efforts by more than 2,000 firefighters. The X account RTSG News, which claims to be “the only source that reports #RealNewsOnly”, posted two pictures, one supposedly of Irfan Razack and the other of the complex in flames. Describing the post as a “Report”, the user claimed that the firm that was responsible for the maintenance work at Wang Fuk Court, Prestige Construction, was owned by an Irfan Razack, an Indian. 🚨🇭🇰🇮🇳 REPORT: The company Prestige Construction, which was responsible for the Hong Kong Fire, is owned by Irfan Razack, an Indian billionaire entrepreneur from Bangalore.

It further says, “We prize our independence, reliablity, and editorial discipline. All articles and posts are vigorously fact-checked and researched by our writers and editors”. First, Irfan Razack, whose photo is attached in the above post, is the CMD of Prestige Group, which is a real estate company based in Bangalore, India. Whereas the firm linked to the Wang Fuk Court project is Prestige Constructions, a Hong Kong-based engineering company, contracted to perform maintenance work on the building. They are two different companies, entirely unrelated. It is also worth noting that according to Reuters, the two directors and an engineering consultant of Prestige Constructions had been arrested by the police under suspicion of manslaughter for using unsafe materials. To sum up, Irfan Razack, the CMD of Prestige Group based in Bangalore, India, has no relation with the firm Prestige Constructions, the company contracted for the maintenance work on the building. The claim that an Indian-owned firm was responsible for the building’s upkeep is baseless.

Viral video of man trying to fly using makeshift wings is AI-generated,"A 10-second-long clip showing a man attempting to fly off a building using a makeshift flying machine and then falling down on the roof of a car is viral on social media. Users are sharing the video and mocking the man by using the caption: “After the Wright brothers… the wrong brother”. X user DEBASHISH NEOGI (@DEBU_NEOGI) posted the above-mentioned video on December 1 with the aforementioned caption.

Below are a few instances. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Alt News has received requests on its WhatsApp helpline to verify the video. We noticed some discrepancies in the clip that raise doubts about its authenticity. While at the start of the video, one can see that the flying machine used by the man has two blades, once he jumps, two more blades appear, which seem to be floating in the air. Further, right before he falls on the roof of the car, one can again see that the number of blades on the machine used by the man is three. To further verify this clip, we broke it down into several keyframes and ran a reverse image search on a few of them. This led us to an Instagram page called: @aiarti11, which had posted the viral clip on November 27. We also noticed that the video had the watermark, ‘Aiarti11’. A post shared by AI Arti volg (@aiarti11) We noticed that the bio of the user stated, “AI video creator,” and the page had posted several realistic AI-generated videos featuring plus-size people in similar situations. This slideshow requires JavaScript. The page features several other AI-generated videos, mostly with similar characters, and even sometimes features animals in different situations.

"Deepfake alert: Videos of Ravish Kumar, Shiv Aroor and Palki Sharma reporting on NDA leaders’ Pak overtures viral","A video circulating online shows journalist Ravish Kumar accusing Bihar’s National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leaders of funding Pakistan’s Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) through offshore accounts to propagate a pro-India stand around Operation Sindoor. Breaking News: Senior Indian Journalist Ravish Kumar explains how PTI of Pakistan established links with NDA in Bihar elections, funneling Indian tax payers money right under the nose of Modi Government to PTI leaders to prove that India won Op Sindoor. pic.twitter.com/ML0wbIdDns — Dr. Shakeel Ahmad Khan (@Shakeel_A_Khan0) November 20, 2025 The same video can be found on Instagram and Facebook as well. Upon closer observation, we noticed several anomalies in the viral video. One noticeable issue is Kumar’s voice, which has a monotonous pitch without any modulation — a common characteristic of AI-generated videos. Additionally, there are instances of mispronunciation. For example, at the 0:26 mark, Kumar incorrectly pronounces the Hindi word ‘नेता’ as ‘नेताहं.’ We found the original video on the official YouTube page Ravish Kumar Official. No mention of the NDA’s connection with the PTI was mentioned by Kumar at any point during the video. Journalist Vrinda Sharma, who works for Ravish Kumar’s YouTube page, also refuted the viral video in an X post, calling it ‘completely fake’. Her post was a response to a now-deleted tweet containing the same video. This is completely fake!! An AI generated video of something that @ravish_journo never ever said. Why are you spreading these fake videos of journalists @abubakarqassam??? Who is handling this account? This is so, so wrong!@zoo_bear @AltNews this is bonkers https://t.co/UDyUfqsqGV — Vrinda Sharma (@vrindajourno) November 20, 2025 To sum up, a deepfake video of Ravish Kumar is viral on social media where he is heard claiming that NDA leaders in Bihar funded Pakistan’s PTI to propagate a pro-India stand surrounding Operation Sindoor. Two more videos — one of journalist Palki Sharma and one of NDTV managing editor Shiv Aroor — are also viral wherein they are heard making similar claims of the NDA in Bihar channeling money to Pakistan’s PTI. ‏بھارتی فنڈنگ پر پلنے والے پی ٹی آئی کے حرامزادے ملک دشمن ہیں، جو زبان انڈین میڈیا بولتا ہے وہی زبان پی ٹی آئی کی سوشل… Posted by Abro Ahsan on Friday 21 November 2025 Akin to the video of Ravish Kumar, the two viral clips circulating online also have tell-tale sigs of AI manipulation. A closer look at the clips shows the presenters’ eyes shift in repetitive loops, and the speech has the flat, uniform cadence typical of AI-generated voiceovers. We also cross-checked the claim by going through Firstpost and NDTV’s YouTube channels, and the social media accounts of Palki Sharma and Shiv Aroor. We did not find any such report or alleged investigation into Bihar NDA leaders’ funding Pakistan’s PTI. It can thus be conclusively stated that the videos are digitally manufactured using AI.

"Sonam Wangchuk ‘safe & sound’, confirms his wife amid deepfakes announcing his ‘death’ going viral","Clippings from news bulletins apparently reporting Sonam Wangchuk’s death in the Jodhpur Central Jail have surfaced on social media and are being widely shared across platforms. Some of these purported bulletins are by prominent news anchors while one shows Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi addressing a press conference. Pakistani propaganda account M. (@Mushk_0) circulated four such videos, alleging India was facing “major and sensitive developments” following the “reports” of the death of renowned Ladakh activist Sonam Wangchuk while in detention at Jodhpur Central Jail. This is a video depicting a press conference by Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi. He can be heard extending his condolences to Wangchuk’s family. In the clip, he also calls for a “thorough and transparent inquiry”. (Archive) Following the custodial death of Sonam Wangchuk, Indian Army chief Gen. Upendra Dwivedi offered condolences, now being suppressed by media. Even the Army seems exhausted by Hindutva fascists forcing their own agenda. pic.twitter.com/YOmc5Z3dwK — M. (@Mushk_0) November 27, 2025 The post has garnered around 201,500 views. A reverse image search on a keyframe led us to a YouTube video uploaded by WION whose logo is visible on the viral clip. It shows an address by General Upendra Dwivedi where he speaks on Operation Sindoor. We compared the two frames and found several similarities, indicating that the clip shared by the X user is digitally manipulated. The comparison can be seen below: On November 27, 2025, speaking at the inaugural session of the third edition of Chanakya Defence Dialogue 2025, General Dwivedi outlined a “set of springboards” intended to guide the army’s long-term transformation, ensuring that the force remains decisive and future-ready in this rapidly evolving global landscape, as reported by the media. He did not make any comment about Wangchuk. During our investigation, we found the Press Information Bureau (PIB) had officially flagged the clip as an altered video of the General Dwivedi, and clarified that he had made no such statements. #Pakistani propaganda accounts are circulating a digitally altered video of Chief of the Army Staff, General Upendra Dwivedi, in which he appears to be talking about the custodial death of Sonam Wangchuk.#PIBFactCheck ❌ This #fake video has been created using #AI technology.… pic.twitter.com/dGFUR2m1Kd — PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) November 27, 2025 Sonam Wangchuk’s wife, Gitanjali J Angmo, confirmed to Alt News that she met her husband on November 28, 2025. She said, “he is safe and sound.” This is a video styled as a news bulletin from FirstPost featuring anchor Palki Sharma. She apparently informs the viewers that Wangchuk died inside Jodhpur Central Jail following what authorities describe as a medical collapse. Sharma can be heard mentioning that the supporters of Wangchuk were allegedly raising concerns about him being tortured in custody. (Archive) Disturbing reports claim Sonam Wangchuk is no longer alive, allegedly tortured in state custody by the Indian government. A viral clip exposing this was taken down minutes after posting. Authorities seem desperate to suppress it & silence Ladakh protests. pic.twitter.com/hQg6Tusecm — M. (@Mushk_0) November 27, 2025 A reverse image search on a keyframe led us to an episode of the news segment, Vantage, hosted by anchor Palki Sharma on the FirstPost YouTube channel on November 26. In the segment, Sharma does not refer to Sonam Wangchuk or any claim regarding his death. The episode focused on China initiating a call with the US President. The comparison between the frames of the viral video and the segment shows several similarities between the backdrop and Sharma’s outfit, indicating that the video has been digitally manipulated. Therefore, the video purporting to show news anchor Palki Sharma reporting on Sonam Wangchuk’s death in custody is a digitally altered deepfake video. Similarly, this video, formatted like an NDTV bulletin featuring anchor Shiv Aroor, shows a ‘report’ on the death of Wangchuk in Jodhpur Central Jail. Aroor said that the officials had cited medical reasons, while his supporters alleged custodial death. (Archive) Shame on you @ShivAroor. Laughing while the Indian government allegedly mercilessly killed Sonam Wangchuk is beyond disgusting. This is cold-blooded murder, and your casual reaction is appalling. Boycott NDTV. pic.twitter.com/dCbOl9pgzm — M. (@Mushk_0) November 27, 2025 The video amassed around 164,000 views. Upon a closer examination of the clip, we noticed a glaring inconsistency: Though the video seeks to display an NDTV bulletin with a logo of the channel, in the background, the AajTak logo remains clearly visible on a glass panel. A reverse image search led us to the original video uploaded by India Today on their YouTube channel on February 28. In the broadcast, Shiv Aroor announced leaving the channel. He is at present a managing editor at NDTV. Below is a comparison between a frame from the viral video and the said bulletin: Because the authentic video is eight months old, it obviously contains no reference to Wangchuk or any claims regarding his death. Aroor himself also addressed the issue and shared a post on X flagging the video as a manipulation by artificial intelligence. I love how this deepfake AI video has the NDTV logo but an Aaj Tak studio background from my earlier place of work. Come on, guys, you can do better 🙂 https://t.co/1ODtHyxTHx — Shiv Aroor (@ShivAroor) November 27, 2025 Hence, it is clear that the video depicting Shiv Aroor reporting on Sonam Wangchuk’s death in custody is fake. It is a digitally manipulated video. The fourth video appears to be an India Today news segment announcing the death of Sonam Wangchuk in custody, with his supporters raising the possibility of custodial killing. The clip claims that Wangchuk’s family complained about “receiving delayed information, denial of immediate access to the body, and the presence of possible injury marks”. (Archive) The extrajudicial killing of Sonam Wangchuk sparks suspicion as central agencies attempt to suppress the news. Things are grim for Ladakh, this Modi regime has crossed all limits of sanity. pic.twitter.com/KsjWNbA0af — M. (@Mushk_0) November 27, 2025 A reverse image search led us to an X post made by India Today on November 26. The post includes a segment with anchor Jessica Goel, who reports on Karnataka leader D K Shivakumar’s cryptic message to the high command, “Word power is world power.” Amid the Karnataka CM race, DK Shivakumar’s cryptic message to the high command — ‘Word power is world power’@sagayrajp with more details#Karnataka #DKShivakumar #Congress | @jessica_goel pic.twitter.com/eNeSoeHVCa — IndiaToday (@IndiaToday) November 26, 2025 In the segment, Goel does not refer to Sonam Wangchuk or any claim regarding his death. A side-by-side comparison of the two frames from the viral video and the original segment indicates a digital manipulation of the audio. See the comparison below: Therefore, the video depicting India Today anchor Jessica Goel reporting Sonam Wangchuk’s death in custody is a deepfake. To sum up, the claims of Wangchuk’s custodial death that are circulating on social media are false and baseless. This was confirmed to Alt News by the activist’s wife, Gitanjali.

"Attack against Muslims in India? No, viral video of woman collapsing is from Bangladesh","A video showing a woman in a burqa being hit by a man on the head is viral on social media with some users claiming that it was a case of an attack on a Muslims in India. The woman in the video collapses on the ground as people from passing vehicles look on. X user New Muslims (@Muslims_2025) posted this clip on November 26 and mentioned in the caption: “Attacks against Muslims in India continue, and we call on the Indian authorities to protect the Muslim community”. At the time of this report being written, the post has received over 363,000 views and has been reposted over 4,800 times. (Archive) Another X user, Parmanand Azamgarhi (@parmanandyadavv), whose bio states that he is the national secretary of Samajwadi Party chatra sabha, also posted the same clip on November 26 and mentioned in the caption: “Sanatani people are mistreating women of other religions, especially Muslim women, and no action is being taken against these people. The Constitution grants equality to everyone.” This post has received more than 370,000 views so far and has been reposted over 1,800 times. Several other users shared the viral clip with the claim that it is an incident in India. One such post can be viewed here. Fact Check On taking a close look at the video, we noticed an advertisement board with text written in Bengali script. We noticed that the board said, “Madrasatul Ehsan Al-Islamia”, and the fourth and fifth lines said, “In the academic year 2024” and “Admissions open”. On running a Google search, we found an educational institution by the same name in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We went through the institution’s Facebook page, and the address on the page said, “83/1, Road – 2, Kalyanpur, Mirpur, Bangladesh”. This shows that the institution is based in Bangladesh, which indicates that the location of the viral clip is Bangladesh, not India. Additionally, it should be also noted the last frame of the video shows a vehicle passing by, which has ‘Energypac JAC’ written on its front panel. JAC Motors is an automobile major from China. Their vehicles are not available in Indian markets. Enerygpac, on the other hand, is a Bangladeshi company that is the sole distributor of JAC Motors in the Bangladeshi market. If one looks more closely, the number plate of the vehicle can be seen written in Bengali. Though not very clear, one can discern the word ‘মেট্রো’ (Metro) written on it. Compare that with the image of a blue JAC truck from Dhaka in the photo below, which is a screengrab from a YouTube video uploaded by Dhaka Mirpur Motors. Therefore, it is clear that the viral video is from Bangladesh and not from India. The claims that the video shows an attack on a Muslim in India is false.

CEC Gyanesh Kumar’s Claim Of India “Invited” To Chair IDEA Is Misleading,"Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar stated on December 1, that India had been “invited” by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA)’s 37 member states to chair the organisation for the first time in its 30-year history. However, the claim is misleading. International IDEA’s Rules of Procedure indicate that India’s upcoming chairship is part of a predetermined rotational system, not a special invitation. International IDEA, is an intergovernmental organisation that supports democracy worldwide. It was founded in 1995, and is made up of 35 member states, and includes United States and Japan as observer states. India, headed by the CEC Kumar, is set to assume its chairship in 2026 as part of the fixed rotation. India's apex election body is facing a backlash over the implementation of the Special Intensive Revision exercise in 12 states to clean voter rolls. The Election Commission is also fending off allegations from opposition parties of serious irregularities in voter lists in various states. The Claim: India was invited for the first time by 37 democracies to chair IDEA On December 1, 2025, CEC Kumar told a group of reporters, it was the first time in 30 years that India was assuming the chairship and that 'the world recognises the successful conduct of free, fair and transparent elections in India.' #WATCH | Delhi | Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar says, ""The world recognises the successful conduct of free, fair and transparent elections in India. Therefore, for the first time in its history of 30 years, the group of 37 democratic countries of the world have… pic.twitter.com/JlKBDCDacX Click here to view an archive. The Election Commission of India's official X handle also posted the statement delivered in Hindi by Kumar. “यह भारत के सभी नागरिकों और सभी चुनावकर्मियों के लिए अत्यंत गौरव का क्षण है।” - CEC ज्ञानेश कुमार, International IDEA की अध्यक्षता ग्रहण करने से पूर्व@Int_IDEA #ECI pic.twitter.com/eV4L69XvjQ Click here to view an archive. What We Found: 1) Chairship decided through fixed rotation CEC Kumar’s claim that 37 democracies “invited” India for the first time is misleading as the chairship follows a rule-based rotation, and not merit-based or a discretionary invitation. We checked the International IDEA’s Rules of Procedure (approved on December 6, 2024) shows that the Chair of the Council of Member States is not selected through invitations issued by member countries. Instead, the Chair is chosen from a pre-assigned “Chairship Group Rotation”, listed in Annex 1 of the document. 2) Rotation schedule till 2033 The rotation schedule allocates specific years to groups of member states well in advance, and the schedule is fixed up to 2033. According to Annex 1, India, Mauritius, and Mexico are the designated Chairship Group for 2026. This shows that India’s turn was structurally pre-determined. We can see the below the list of Chairship group rotation from 2020 to 2036.

Video Of Kashmir BSF Chief Blaming Government For Lack Of Funds Is A Deepfake,"A video purportedly showing Border Security Force (BSF) Inspector General of Kashmir Frontier Ashok Yadav saying that the force achieved nothing on counterterrorism because the central government is refusing to provide procurement budgets and funds is being peddled online as a real footage. BOOM found the video has been manipulated using AI. In the original press conference, Yadav made no such remarks against the central government. In the viral 1 minute 9 seconds footage, Yadav can be heard claiming that the BSF did not neutralise any terrorist, accusing the intelligence wing of misidentifying cows, shadows and even their own patrols as high value threats. The BSF IG then appears to say that the force did not spot anything even after closely monitoring 69 launching pads and that around 100 to 120 terrorists might already have entered the country across the LoC as per the force's latest assessment. The Claim A verified X user shared the video with the caption, ""Breaking News BSF IG KASHMIR ASHOK YADAV MAKES SHOCKING REVELATIONS. ""We have achieved zero on counter terrorism because the Centre government is refusing to provide us with our procurement budgets and funds, we are absolutely failing."" Click here to view the post and here for an archive. 1. Original ANI news report: We broke the video into keyframes and ran a reverse image search on them using Google Lens. The search led us to a video post from ANI’s official X handle from December 1, 2025, which matches the visuals seen in the viral clip. Neither the post nor the video of BSF IG Kashmir Frontier Ashok Yadav contains any comment against the central government as heard in the viral version. We also found the live stream of Yadav’s press conference from December 1, 2025, on ANI’s official YouTube channel and did not find any such remark against the central government. The original statement by Yadav about the BSF's G unit monitoring all 69 active launching pads along the LoC and the terrorists waiting to infiltrate can be watched here. 2. AI Detector Tool Flags Manipulation: We tested the video using AI detector Deepfake-o-Meter developed by the University of Buffalo. The tool examined the clip across several parameters used to identify deepfake content, and most of them indicated possible AI manipulation in the viral video. The central government's fact checking unit, PIB Fact Check, also refuted the claim and said Yadav has not made any such remark. 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

Document Alleging India Asked Pakistan To Hand Over Imran Khan Is Fake,"A document stamped “Top Secret” and attributed to India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), claiming that New Delhi had formally requested Pakistan to transfer former Prime Minister Imran Khan to India for his “personal security,” is fake. BOOM found no record of such a letter being issued by the MEA, nor any credible reporting suggesting that the Indian government made such an offer. The document is the latest in an influence operation carried out by a cluster of X handles are targeting India in a bid to destabilise the online discourse through a mix of videos manipulated with AI, fake quotes, bogus letters and fabricated news articles. Imran Khan has been incarcerated in Pakistan since August 5, 2023, after he was arrested following his conviction in the Toshakhana case, in which he was accused of illegally selling state gifts received as prime minister and failing to declare the proceeds to the country's Election Commission. Although the trial court’s sentence was later suspended, he remains in custody due to several other pending cases. The Claim: Leaked letter by MEA asking for Imran Khan to be transferred as a political prisoner to India The viral letter claims that the MEA has “credible information” about threats to Khan’s life in Pakistan and therefore requests the Pakistani government to temporarily transfer him to a “secure location in India,” with assurances that he would be kept in protective custody and returned once the situation stabilises. The letter was posted by the X handle @abubakarqassam. Breaking News:Top secret letter of the Indian Ministery of External Affairs gets leaked on Social Media. Indian Government has requested Pakistan to send Imran Khan as a political prisoner to India just like Haseena Wajid. pic.twitter.com/mCTHfssLwW Click here to view an archive. What We Found: 1) Inaccuracies in the Letter The first give away is that the viral image shows the letter placed on a wooden desk with dramatic side-lighting, creating a stylised shadow effect. There is only one photo available online and no credible media reports on any such document being leaked. An official diplomatic communication letter even if top secret would be neutral. Words like “political prisoner,” “secure location,” stand out. The letter also uses Imran Khan’s full name - Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi, whereas official Indian letters in the past have referred to him simply as Imran Khan. 2) No Official Record We also checked the Ministry of External Affairs website, official press releases, public statements, and did not find any such letter. The central government's fact-checking unit, PIB Fact Check, also refuted the claim. We also checked MEA's PAI [Pakistan, Afghanistan & Iran] Division, and did not find such a letter or recent communication. BOOM reached out to the MEA for a response, the article will be updated on receiving one. 3) X Handle Part of Anti-India Influence Operation BOOM has previously fact-checked multiple AI-generated videos targeting Indian military officials that were posted by the Pakistani X handle @abubakarqassam. This account is part of a larger network of Pakistani X handles that routinely share misleading, fabricated, or AI cheapfake videos targeting India. 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

Video Of Navy Chief Slamming IAF Over Operation Sindoor Is A Deepfake,"A video claiming to show Navy Chief Admiral Dinesh K. Tripathi criticising the Indian Air Force (IAF) by saying the Indian fighter jets were detected and tracked by advanced Pakistan Navy systems during Operation Sindoor, is fake. BOOM found that the video has been altered with artificial intelligence (AI) to add a fake voice-over to it. The doctored video is part of a co-ordinated influence operation carried out by a cluster of X handles are targeting India in a bid to destabilise the online discourse through a mix of videos manipulated with AI, fake quotes, bogus letters and fabricated news articles. The navy chief admiral also appears to be saying the following: ""If we had deployed major naval assets forward; even a minor contact or exaggerated claim could have been turned into a global embarrassment. Keeping our capital ships inside was a deliberate forced protection and perception management choice."" (sic) The Claim An X account by the handle @AzizRehman1011 posted the video with the caption, ""Breaking News Navy Chief Dinesh K Tripathi throws shade at the Indian Air Force: “Keeping our capital ships inside was a strategic move deny Pakistan the drama they crave. The Navy safeguarded its credibility. Maybe the Air Force should note: sometimes the strongest response is refusing to play the enemy’s script.”"" Click here to view the post and here for an archive. 1. The Original Press Conference: We ran a related keyword search on YouTube and found the original press conference by Chief of Naval Staff Dinesh K. Tripathi that was streamed live on ANI's official YouTube channel on December 2, 2025. When compared, we also found a match between the visuals in the viral video and the annual press briefing by Tripathi held in New Delhi. We did not any remarks that match the statements in the viral video. 2. AI Detector Tool Flags Manipulation: Taking a cue, we tested the video on the AI detector tool Deepfake-o-Meter, developed by the University of Buffalo. The tool used multiple deepfake detection models, and several of them indicated possible AI manipulation in the viral video. The Press Information Bureau’s fact checking wing also clarified that Admiral Tripathi never issued any remarks like the ones heard in the viral video. 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

Video Of Haryana Youth Crying For Help From Russian Warzone Is AI Generated,"An artificial intelligence (AI) generated video claiming to show an Indian youth from Haryana fighting for the Russian Army and desperately pleading for help from the Indian government, is circulating online as a real video. The 15 second clip shows the youth speaking in Hindi and appealing to people to circulate the video as widely as possible so that it reaches the government. The young man in the video claims ten of his companions have already died, making him the lone survivor. BOOM found the footage does not contain real visuals. Multiple AI detector tests confirmed that the video was created using artificial intelligence. The Claim The video was posted by the X handle @Baba_Thoka with the following caption: ""Studying in India has become so expensive that Haryana’s youth rushed to Russia for his future; only to be thrown into a warzone after 10 days of ‘training’. Now, some families have received partial bodies, some sons are missing, and one survivor is begging New Delhi for help."" Click here to view an archive of the post. The same synthetic video is circulating with a similar caption in Hindi. Click here to view the post and here for an archive. AI Detector Tools Flag Manipulation: We first tried to trace the video but found no credible source confirming it to be a real appeal from an Indian youth in the Russian warzone. Taking a cue, we tested the video on the AI detector tool Hive Moderation which concluded with 99 per cent confidence that the footage is likely AI generated or deepfake content. Furthermore, we tested the video on another AI video detector tool, Deepfake o Meter, developed by the University of Buffalo. We used multiple parameters on the tool to examine the video, and several of them indicated with high confidence that it is AI generated and contains fake visuals. A test using the AI voice detector tool Hiya also concluded that the voice in the video has a high probability of being a deepfake. 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

#Lok Sabha,"The Lok Sabha is the lower house of India's bicameral Parliament, representing the citizens directly and holding a critical role in the country's legislative process. Formed in 1952 following India's independence, the Lok Sabha has 545 seats, including two seats reserved for Anglo-Indian representatives, though this provision was recently discontinued. Members of the Lok Sabha, known as Members of Parliament (MPs), are elected every five years through general elections conducted across the country. The Lok Sabha has substantial powers, including the ability to pass bills, approve budgets, and amend the Constitution. It also has the authority to initiate money bills, giving it control over financial legislation—a power not vested in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house). The Prime Minister of India is typically the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha and is appointed by the President of India. The Speaker, who presides over the sessions, is responsible for maintaining order and ensuring that legislative procedures are followed. Important legislative and policy debates are conducted here, with sessions often setting the agenda for national governance. The current Lok Sabha, the 17th, was formed following the 2019 general elections, with the next elections due in 2024. In July 2024, BOOM fact-checked a viral claim alleging that Anjali Birla, daughter of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, had cleared the UPSC Civil Services Examination without appearing for any exams. BOOM’s investigation revealed that this claim was false; Anjali Birla had indeed cleared both the preliminary and main examinations, dispelling rumors and confirming the legitimacy of her accomplishment. - By Hera Rizwan | 21 Aug 2025 5:18 PM IST - By Ritika Jain | 20 Aug 2025 6:55 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 4 Aug 2025 7:47 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 31 July 2025 6:39 PM IST - By Ritika Jain | 7 July 2025 2:13 PM IST - By Ritika Jain | 15 April 2025 4:29 PM IST - By BOOM Team | 11 April 2025 7:27 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 8 April 2025 8:08 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 7 April 2025 4:15 PM IST - By Ritika Jain | 5 April 2025 5:04 PM IST - By Reuters | 11 Feb 2025 4:08 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 31 Dec 2024 9:11 AM IST 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

#Narendra Modi,"Narendra Modi, born in 1950, Vadnagar, Gujarat is the current Prime Minister of India since 2014. He started his political journey with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) before joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 1980s. Modi served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014.. BOOM has debunked several pieces of misinformation surrounding Modi and also claims made on or by Modi. One instance involved a viral video falsely depicting PM Modi urging people to ""Vote for Congress"" during a public rally. BOOM found that the video was edited, with two separate clips merged together to create the video. The original clip actually showed Modi encouraging people to vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Similarly, a misleading photo circulated on social media falsely claiming that PM Modi had ignored greetings from President Droupadi Murmu and other dignitaries during an event commemorating Dr. B R Ambedkar's death anniversary. - By Shivam Bhardwaj | 24 Nov 2025 9:00 AM IST - By Srijanee Chakraborty | 21 Nov 2025 6:15 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 21 Nov 2025 3:46 PM IST - By Srijit Das | 14 Nov 2025 5:31 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso & Rohit Kumar | 14 Nov 2025 2:55 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 10 Nov 2025 3:10 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 29 Oct 2025 4:00 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 13 Oct 2025 2:38 PM IST - By Srijanee Chakraborty | 11 Oct 2025 4:11 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 24 Sept 2025 3:10 PM IST - By Karen Rebelo & Anmol Alphonso | 17 Sept 2025 7:06 PM IST - By Srijit Das | 16 Sept 2025 5:43 PM IST 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

#Rahul Gandhi,"Rahul Gandhi is an Indian politician and a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress (INC). Born on June 19, 1970, he is the son of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, the former President of the INC. Known for his focus on social justice, economic development, and democratic rights, Gandhi has been an active voice in Indian politics, advocating for issues such as poverty alleviation, education, and anti-corruption reforms. Over the years, he has taken on key roles within the Congress Party, including serving as its President from 2017 to 2019, and he continues to play a significant role in shaping the party’s policies and direction. In July 2024, BOOM fact-checked a viral video claiming to show people in Manipur chanting “Go Back” slogans against Gandhi. BOOM’s investigation revealed that the video was actually from Assam in January 2024, during Gandhi’s ‘Bharat Jodo Nyay’ march. In September 2024, BOOM fact-checked a viral, cropped video that was being shared with the claim that Gandhi threatened Hindus. BOOM’s investigation found that the full video actually showed Gandhi criticizing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accusing them of weaponizing institutions like the CBI, ED, and the Election Commission. - By Srijanee Chakraborty | 14 Nov 2025 9:19 AM IST - By Srijit Das | 31 Oct 2025 3:17 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 24 Oct 2025 2:50 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 3 Oct 2025 4:14 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 22 Sept 2025 4:12 PM IST - By Srijit Das | 18 Sept 2025 4:15 PM IST - By Srijit Das | 10 Sept 2025 11:59 AM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 25 Aug 2025 3:25 PM IST - By Archis Chowdhury | 23 Aug 2025 4:22 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 20 Aug 2025 5:02 PM IST - By Shefali Srivastava & Srijit Das | 16 July 2025 4:53 PM IST - By Srijanee Chakraborty | 15 July 2025 6:43 PM IST 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

#West Bengal,"West Bengal is a state located in the eastern part of India, bordered by Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim, and the Bay of Bengal to the south. The capital city is Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, which serves as the cultural, political, and economic hub of the state. West Bengal is known for its rich history, diverse culture, literature, music, and vibrant festivals. Historically, West Bengal has played a central role in India's freedom struggle, with prominent leaders like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, and Swami Vivekananda contributing to its socio-political landscape. It was also the epicenter of the Bengal Renaissance, which saw a significant cultural and intellectual awakening in the 19th century. The state was partitioned in 1947, leading to the creation of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and the present-day West Bengal. The state has a diverse economy, with industries like jute, tea, textiles, and information technology playing significant roles. Agriculture is also a major sector, with rice, jute, and tea being key crops. The Siliguri Corridor, often referred to as the ""Chicken's Neck,"" serves as a strategic passage connecting the northeastern states to the rest of India. Politically, West Bengal has been a battleground for different ideologies. It was ruled by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M)-led Left Front for over three decades, from 1977 to 2011, making it one of the longest-serving democratically elected communist governments in the world. In 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), led by Mamata Banerjee, came to power, marking a shift in the state's political landscape. Banerjee has since focused on issues like infrastructure development, social welfare schemes, and education reform. As of 2024, she remains the Chief Minister, following her re-election in the 2021 Assembly elections. In June 2024, BOOM fact-checked a viral video claiming to show an Eid sacrifice in West Bengal. BOOM was able to geo-locate the video to a residential complex in Mirpur, Bangladesh, debunking the false claim that it originated in West Bengal. - By Srijit Das | 15 Nov 2025 5:44 PM IST - By Srijanee Chakraborty | 11 Nov 2025 6:38 PM IST - By Srijanee Chakraborty | 22 Aug 2025 3:57 PM IST - By Snigdhendu Bhattacharya | 19 Aug 2025 2:58 PM IST - By Srijanee Chakraborty | 5 Aug 2025 4:33 PM IST - By Joymala Bagchi | 4 Aug 2025 1:32 PM IST - By Srijit Das | 29 July 2025 6:15 PM IST - By Srijit Das | 28 April 2025 9:09 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 22 April 2025 6:38 PM IST - By Shivam Bhardwaj | 22 April 2025 10:13 AM IST - By Srijanee Chakraborty | 21 April 2025 4:58 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 21 April 2025 2:17 PM IST 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

The debate at the Oxford Union, scheduled for November 27, 2025, was ultimately canceled. Following the cancellation, the Pakistan High Commission claimed the Indian speakers backed out at the last minute, while the Indian side maintained the program was canceled due to the absence of the official Pakistani delegation, and that India was later falsely accused. The Claim An X account with the username @Kussikhuelafn shared the video with the caption, ""My report from yesterday has now been confirmed by Sachin Pilot. The Indian delegation’s walkout happened under pressure from the Modi govt. Why is the BJP humiliating my India on the world stage? Why were the moral values and reputation of Indians damaged across the globe?"" Click here to view the post. 1. AI Detector Tools Flag Manipulation: We found no credible news reports to corroborate that Pilot made such remarks. When we checked the viral footage on AI detector tools including Deepfake-o-Meter, Hive Moderation and the AI voice detector tool Hiya, the results showed that the video has been altered with the help of AI. Deepfake-o-Meter’s lip sync detection model flagged the footage as up to 99.3 percent fake and potentially AI generated. Hive Moderation also indicated that the video is up to 99 percent AI generated. The AI voice detector tool Hiya has also given the video's audio an authenticity score of 1 out of 100, which indicates the chances of it being AI are quite high. Congress leader Sachin Pilot has also posted on his X handle and described the video as fake. 2. The Original India Today Report: We then found out the original video of Sachin Pilot on India Today’s official YouTube channel, posted on October 5, 2025. In that video report, the Congress leader can be heard describing his visit to Rajasthan NSUI President Vinod Jakhar, who was detained by the police. 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

#Maharashtra Elections 2024,"The 2024 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election was held on November 20, 2024, with the ruling Mahayuti alliance emerging victorious securing a majority of 235 seats in the 288-member of the 15th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. Devendra Fadnavis, a senior BJP leader, was sworn in for his third term as Chief Minister on December 5, 2024, 12 days after the election results were announced on November 23. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured the largest number of 132 seats in the Maha Yuti alliance, followed by Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena with 57 seats and Ajit Pawar's NCP faction securing 41. The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition, faced a significant loss by winning only 46 assembly seats. In the opposition coalition, Congress won 16 seats, Shiv Sena (UBT) 20 seats, and Sharad Pawar’s NCP faction 10 seats. For over six decades, this is the first instance a ruling party has won so spectacularly that there is no other party claiming to be in opposition. There were at least about 4136 contestants in the elections and out of this the election witnessed a 66.05% voter turnout which was said to be the highest since 1995. A total of 4,136 candidates contested the elections. The 2024 elections were heavily influenced by political realignments following the 2022 Maharashtra political crisis, which saw Shiv Sena MLA Eknath Shinde rebel against Uddhav Thackeray, leading to the collapse of the MVA government. Shinde subsequently formed a government with the BJP, taking over as Chief Minister. Later, in 2023, Ajit Pawar’s split from the NCP further strengthened the Maha Yuti alliance. The campaign for the 2024 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections witnessed an intense battle between the ruling Maha Yuti alliance and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The Maha Yuti, focused on governance achievements and welfare schemes like Majhi Ladki Bahin for women empowerment. Leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah highlighted economic growth and infrastructure development under their ""double-engine"" government model. The opposition MVA, emphasized issues like social justice, unemployment, and a caste-based census. Among many allegations, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi blamed the BJP for not standing for the backward communities, while Uddhav Thackeray held Eknath Shinde responsible for abandoning Shiv Sena as it used to be earlier. Sharad Pawar expressed his concerns for the strong dominance of BJP and emphasized the significance of having a united front. BOOM has debunked several posts with misinformation surrounding the assembly election. These posts included AI generated audio voice clones to fake news graphics. BOOM has fact-checked a viral photo claiming that a Pakistani flag was visible during a roadshow by Ajit Pawar and Nawab Malik in Mumbai. BOOM found out the flag in the background is an Islamic religious flag commonly seen during religious events like Muharram or Eid Milad-un-Nabi. The Pakistani flag has the white band which is missing in the flag shown on the viral photo. The photo was from a November 7, 2024, roadshow in Shivaji Nagar, Mankhurd, and was confirmed through Nawab Malik’s original post. BOOM has debunked similar misinformation in the past. BOOM fact-checked a viral Pudhari News graphic claiming that Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut stated his party would provide ₹3,000 to women and ₹6,000 to Muslim women under a nutritional scheme if Uddhav Thackeray became Chief Minister. BOOM found that the claim is false. The graphic is fabricated, and Pudhari News confirmed to BOOM that it does not use the font shown in the viral image. BOOM fact-check a viral video claiming to show Sanjay Raut saying that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will give a clean chit to Dawood Ibrahim if it comes back to power in Maharashtra. BOOM found that the viral video has been edited to misrepresent Sanjay Raut's statement. In the original video, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader was targeting the ruling BJP government in response to a reporter's question about SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch reportedly getting a clean chit. Raut stated that the BJP government would even go as far as giving Dawood Ibrahim a clean chit, emphasizing his criticism of the ruling party. BOOM fact-checked a photo claiming to show a political ad by BJP urging voters to elect the Mahayuti alliance for the ""progress of Gujarat"" instead of Maharashtra. BOOM found that the viral photo is digitally altered. The original ad, featuring Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, promotes the BJP's slogan for Maharashtra’s progress. A closer look at the viral image reveals that the word ""Gujarat"" has been digitally added, as it visibly stands out from the rest of the text. In November 2024, BOOM debunked misinformation around Maharashtra assembly election and US elections. A total of 62.6% of the fact-checks conducted by BOOM that month involved false content, followed by fabricated AI-generated misinformation. Maharashtra Assembly elections accounted for 18.7% of the total fact-checks. - By Anmol Alphonso | 31 Dec 2024 9:11 AM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 9 Dec 2024 3:58 PM IST - By BOOM Team | 7 Dec 2024 11:33 AM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 30 Nov 2024 2:39 PM IST - By Nidhi Jacob | 29 Nov 2024 4:59 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 26 Nov 2024 2:56 PM IST - By Nivedita Niranjankumar | 22 Nov 2024 4:57 PM IST - By Nivedita Niranjankumar | 20 Nov 2024 2:02 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 19 Nov 2024 7:59 PM IST - By Srijanee Chakraborty | 18 Nov 2024 6:26 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 16 Nov 2024 5:53 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 13 Nov 2024 3:47 PM IST 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

#Uddhav Thackeray,"Uddhav Thackeray was the former Chief Minister of Maharashtra from November 28, 2019, to June 29, 2022. He is the son of Bal Thackeray, the late founder of Shiv Sena. He is currently the President of Shiv Sena. In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, comprising Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Pawar faction), and Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray faction), faced a significant defeat. The alliance secured only 46 out of the 288 seats in the assembly, marking a major setback for the coalition. Uddhav Thackeray was born into the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu (CKP) community to Balasaheb and Mina Thackeray on July 27, 1960. He completed his schooling at Balmohan Vidyamandir and graduated in Fine Arts from the Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art, Mumbai. He has authored books named Maharashtra Desh and Pahava Vitthal. Thackeray began his political career as the campaign manager for Shiv Sena during the 2002 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections. In 2003, Balasaheb Thackeray appointed him as the working president of Shiv Sena. In 2006, he took over as Editor-in-Chief of Saamana, the party's Marathi-language mouthpiece. The same year Shiv Sena faced a major split when his cousin, Raj Thackeray, left the party to form the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). After his father’s death in 2012, he was formally elected as the party president in 2013. In 2014, after the state assembly elections, Shiv Sena joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in Maharashtra. However, Shiv Sena and BJP got into disagreements over power-sharing which began to strain their relationship. In the 2019 Assembly election, the party broke the alliance with the BJP due to differences over the chief ministerial position. Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena won 56 seats and formed a post-poll alliance with the Congress, which secured 44 seats, and the Nationalist Congress Party, which secured 54 seats. He went on to form a new coalition government, known as the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). On November 28, 2019, he was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. BOOM has debunked misinformation around Thackeray. In June 2022, Uddhav Thackeray faced a political crisis where senior Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde, along with 37 party MLAs, went against his leadership. A group of rebels declared Shinde as their leader and started operating separately from Thackeray's authority. The Shiv Sena filed a petition asking for the disqualification of 16 MLAs from the camp of Shinde; however, the way of functioning from the Deputy Speaker was under challenge. Meanwhile, a no-confidence motion against the Deputy Speaker was rejected, and Shinde, along with BJP leaders, planned to form a new coalition. The Governor directed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to prove its majority by June 30. On June 29, 2022 hours before the floor test, Uddhav Thackeray resigned as Chief Minister, citing his respect for democratic processes and avoiding further political instability. After Thackeray's resignation, Eknath Shinde, backed by the BJP, went on to form the new government. Shinde took oath as Chief Minister on June 30, 2022, with BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis as his Deputy Chief Minister, marking the end of the MVA government. BOOM has debunked misinformation around Thackeray. BOOM fact-checked a viral video claiming that Uddhav Thackeray, leader of Shiv Sena (UBT), recently called Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ""nalayak"" (useless) and said he should be beaten with shoes. BOOM found that the claim is false. The video is from 2019, long before Thackeray and Gandhi became allies under the INDIA bloc. The video shows Thackeray criticizing Gandhi for insulting Hindutva leader and freedom fighter VD Savarkar at the launch of the book Savarkar: Echoes from a Forgotten Past by Vikram Sampath in September 2019. - By Anmol Alphonso | 19 March 2025 9:21 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 9 Dec 2024 3:58 PM IST - By Nivedita Niranjankumar | 22 Nov 2024 4:57 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 13 Nov 2024 3:47 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 28 Oct 2024 4:05 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 21 Oct 2024 4:08 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 19 Oct 2024 3:30 PM IST - By Anmol Alphonso | 16 Aug 2024 4:26 PM IST - By Hazel Gandhi | 15 Jun 2024 1:05 PM IST - By Mohammed Kudrati | 23 Nov 2019 2:50 PM IST - By Nivedita Niranjankumar | 26 Nov 2019 5:33 PM IST - By Nivedita Niranjankumar | 11 May 2020 7:36 PM IST 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

#Digital Arrest,"Digital Arrest is a cyber scam in which fraudsters impersonate police officers, cybercrime officials, or government authorities to deceive victims into believing they are accused of serious crimes like money laundering or data misuse. The scammers use fake arrest warrants, forged documents, and psychological pressure to extort money or personal details from unsuspecting individuals. They usually contact victims through calls, WhatsApp messages, or emails, claiming urgent legal action unless a “fine” or “bail amount” is paid. To make their threats convincing, they may send official-looking documents or even use deepfake videos as fake evidence. The scam thrives on fear and urgency, pushing victims to act without verification. However, legitimate law enforcement agencies never demand payments or personal information over phone calls. Warning signs include unverified caller IDs, threats of arrest, demands for instant payment via UPI or bank transfers, and refusal to provide official contact details. Decode has reported on the alarming rise of digital arrest scams in India, where fraudsters impersonate law enforcement officers to psychologically trap victims into transferring money or sharing personal data. Victims are kept under constant communication and threatened with arrest or legal action, often losing large sums in fear. The scam’s scale prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to warn citizens in his Mann Ki Baat address to “Stop, think, and act.” Experts told Decode that these scams exploit fear, authority, and low digital literacy, turning psychological manipulation into a powerful tool for cybercrime. - By Ritika Jain | 29 Oct 2025 12:22 PM IST - By Hera Rizwan | 29 Oct 2024 2:49 PM IST - By Hera Rizwan | 27 May 2024 4:11 PM IST - By Hera Rizwan | 22 Jan 2024 5:14 PM IST - By Kaisar Andrabi | 4 Jan 2024 11:51 AM IST 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

BOOM found that the voice-over in the clip is entirely fabricated and generated using artificial intelligence (AI). The manipulated video is part of an ongoing disinformation campaign targeting India's military and national leadership. The Claim: Video shows Chief of Defence Staff Anil Chauhan saying that Indian government has surrendered Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh The video was posted on X by the handle @Hawkss_eye with the caption, ""Breaking News: Kerala: Reviewing Officer of the Passing Out Parade at Indian Naval Academy, Ezhimala, Chief of Defence Staff, General Anil Chauhan says,"" Although I am aware that Indian Government has surrendered Arunachal and Ladakh to China due to our weak airforce but be assured that Indian Navy is not weak & Pakistan will never be able to damage any port city of India.""

How AI-Driven Deepfakes Are Fueling Disinformation Against India On X,"Hours after the deadly crash of an indigenous fighter aircraft, Tejas, that claimed the life of an Indian Air Force pilot at the Dubai Air Show on November 21st; a video appearing to show Air Chief Marshal AP Singh chastising the government against inducting the indigenous fighter jet into the air force, circulated on X. It wasn’t real. Singh never made any such remarks. The clip was fake — the air chief marshal’s voice reconstructed or cloned with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). The fake video was yet another example of a co-ordinated disinformation campaign targeting India since the Pahalgam terror attack in Kashmir and India’s military Operation Sindoor earlier this year. A new frontier of synthetic propaganda A cluster of X handles are targeting India in a bid to destabilise the online discourse through a mix of videos manipulated with AI, fake quotes, bogus letters and fabricated news articles. The Elon Musk-owned platform’s newly introduced ‘About this account’ feature showed their locations as Pakistan. It is not clear who is behind this campaign, however, it bears signatures of an influence operation from a troll farm - synchronised activity, rapid amplification by seemingly unrelated accounts and a mix of fake personas that mimic Indian X users. What makes the operation unique is its indiscriminate use of generative AI. BOOM published more than 30 fact-checks flagging synthetic media, since the Pahalgam terror attack. The campaign has singled out India’s most visible institutions - its military, its national leadership and the national media. The influence operation also attempted to exploit moments of national crisis, widen internal faultlines —- religious polarisation and caste prejudice, and fan tensions in sensitive border areas such as Manipur and Ladakh. New Delhi has responded by pressing X to legally withhold these accounts in India to limit their visibility and by debunking the disinformation through its state-run PIB Fact-Check handle. Sky wars and the battle of narratives India and Pakistan have sparred over the number of fighter jets lost during a four-day conflict that broke out in May this year. Pakistan has asserted it shot down six Indian aircraft. India rejected the claim but acknowledged in an interview, it did lose an unspecified number of fighter jets. An information battlefield without borders BOOM identified key X accounts seeding AI-manipulated videos targeting India since the Pahalgam terror attack. The accounts @InsiderWB, @Baba_Thoka, @Hawkss_eye and @abubakarqassam, featured frequently among debunks published by Indian fact-checkers. The disinformation posted by these handles were amplified by other suspicious accounts which posted rhetoric pro Pakistan army and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party. The Afghan Taliban regime was another target of disinformation and trolling as part of the same campaign. The tweets were deleted after being called out in many instances. We also observed a few central accounts purging their posts periodically, making it harder to detect their role in the disinformation campaign. It is difficult to estimate the total number of accounts in the campaign as many handles such as @InsiderWB, @Baba_Thoka were withheld in India or suspended by the platform after being reported. The disinfo campaign also exhibited signs of inauthentic behaviour. For instance, fake accounts such as @akrittisharma, @TaraSharma02, @Kussikhuelafn tried to camouflage themselves as Indian users. Their profiles had pictures of the tricolour and political slogans. But X’s metadata gave them away showing their location as Pakistan. Prime targets: Top Indian defence personnel The top tier of India’s defence establishment have been consistently targeted by the influence operation. The disinformation narratives include an admission of tactical missteps; territorial concessions to China, fake casualty figures; fabricated statements chastising the government for communalising the army or misusing it for political gains. Other fake narratives included attacking the secular credentials of the armed forces; undermining the perception of the country’s defence capabilities; and conspiracy theories such as the blast near Delhi’s Red Fort being a ‘false flag’ operation by India. Videos of defence personnel giving public speeches were overlaid with AI voice clones to make fabricated statements. Some of the words used in the AI voice clones were Urdu, Pamposh Raina, head of the Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU) of the Trusted Information Alliance, in India told BOOM. The DAU works with a coalition of fact-checkers and experts in synthetic media globally to combat deepfakes. “...I'd say these were chiefs…chief of the army staff, chief of navy, air force and chief of the defense staff; whenever they made any statement; we would always know that okay this is going to be manipulated and that would happen,” Raina told BOOM. In November, a doctored video of General Upendra Dwivedi saying that the Indian Army will reduce non-Hindu soldiers by over 50 percent by 2028, went viral. The deepfake was posted by the handle @Baba_Thoka. DAU’s Raina said military personnel, who historically avoided the spotlight, have given more interviews and made public remarks post Operation Sindoor, making it easier for bad actors to exploit. She also noted how the insignia and name tags on the military uniforms showed signs of distortion, an anomaly usually seen in AI altered videos. The death that wasn’t In a brazen escalation, an account named ‘@Mushk_0’ shared four deepfake videos to claim Sonam Wangchuk died in police custody. The Ladakhi climate activist is being detained under the stringent National Security Act, at a prison in Rajasthan. The politics of falsehoods The network also falsely claimed Bihar’s National Democratic Alliance leaders funneled money to Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party. Deepfakes of independent journalist Ravish Kumar, Firstpost’s managing editor Palki Sharma and NDTV managing editor Shiv Aroor were employed to push the falsehood. The AI voice-overs stumbled over Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s name, pronouncing it as “Neetish Kumar” in more than one deepfake. Why X is fertile ground for influence operations India had 22.17 million X users as of October 2025 making it the platform’s fourth largest market, according to Statista. The disinformation operation comes at a time when Elon Musk and other Big Tech have dismissed or downplayed threats of misinformation and scaled back investments in fact-checking capacity globally.

AI Video Peddled To Falsely Claim Indian Soldier Fearful Of Pakistan,"An AI-generated video showing a crying soldier on a battlefield is being falsely circulated as real footage of an Indian soldier at the Indo-Pakistan border pleading with the Indian government not to confront Pakistan and calling their army “very dangerous.” BOOM found the claim is false. Multiple AI detection tools confirmed the viral video has been generated using artificial intelligence. The Claim An X user posted the viral video with the caption, ""At the Pakistan border, an Indian soldier's cry for help: Modi sleeps in an air conditioned room while we are sent to the Pakistan border to die. Please save me, Modi saar. The Pakistani army is very dangerous, don't mess with them."" (sic) Click here to see post and here for the archive. What We Found Viral Video Is AI Generated: We ran a related keyword search but did not find any credible news reports to corroborate the same. We spotted unnatural eye movement when the soldier blinked. Taking a cue from this, we tested the viral video on Hive Moderation, a tool designed to detect AI content manipulation. Hive Moderation detected the video has 87% probability of being generated using artificial intelligence. Then, we extracted the audio from the viral video and ran it on Hiya Deepfake Voice Detector tool. Hiya gave an authenticity score of only 1 out of 100 indicating the voice is entirely generated using AI. 👉 No spam, no paywall — but verified insights.

Video Of Crying Indian Soldiers Calling Pak Army 'Dangerous' Is AI,"A video generated using artificial intelligence falsely claiming to show two soldiers of the Indian army crying for the Indian government's help from the battlefield has surfaced online as real. The soldiers can heard labelling the the Pakistani army as dangerous while pleading to be released from duty. BOOM found the video does not show any real visuals. We ran the viral video on multiple AI content detection tools and confirmed it to be AI generated. The Claim The 30 second long viral video shows two different soldiers asking the Narendra Modi led Indian government to send them home; one of the soldiers even identify themselves as Prakash. An user on X posted the video with a Urdu caption that translates to, ""Indian Army's message to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Long live Pakistan Army Long live Pakistan."" Click here to see post, here for the archive. What We Found Viral Video Is AI Generated: We ran multiple searches but did not find any credible source that indicated the viral visuals as a real incident. A close observation of the soldiers reveals an unnaturalness in their eyeball movements. Taking a cue, we ran the two visuals of the soldiers separately on multiple AI detection tools including Hive Moderation and Hiya. First Visual AI content detection tool Hive Moderation concluded that there is 82.1% probability of AI manipulation in the video. Then, we extracted the audio from the video and tested it on Hiya Deepfake Voice detector tool. Hiya called out the audio as fake with an authenticity score of only 1 out of 100. See the results below. Second Visual Next, we tested the remaining segment of the viral video on Hive Moderation's AI detector tool which confirmed the video has been manipulated using AI. We also ran the audio extracted from the second clip on Hiya's Deepfake Voice detector and found it to be fake. Hiya's result showed an authenticity score of 1 out of 100.

Deepfake Videos Falsely Claim Sonam Wangchuk Has Died In Police Custody,"An X user shared four viral videos recently that fabricated announcements by India’s Army Chief and prominent news outlets, falsely claiming that Ladakh climate activist Sonam Wangchuk had died in police custody. BOOM found that all four clips are deepfakes, with no credible reports or official statements indicating that Wangchuk has passed away. Furthermore, Wangchuk's wife Gitanjali J Angmo told BOOM that she personally met him on November 28, 2025, after the videos went viral, and confirmed that he is safe. The four videos also fit a growing pattern of AI-generated misinformation impersonating Indian defence officials and journalists. BOOM has previously debunked several such deepfakes circulating after recent political and security developments. The X user (@Mushk_0) posted four videos claiming: 1. Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had announced Wangchuk’s death and offered condolences to his family. (Archived here) 2. Three additional clips showed Firstpost’s Palki Sharma, NDTV’s Shiv Aroor, and an India Today presenter reporting that Wangchuk had died in police custody. (Archived here, here and here) The posts alleged that media outlets and the Army Chief had confirmed his death, and that authorities were suppressing the information.

Video From Italy Peddled As Performance Of IAF At Dubai Air Show,"A video of a flypast creating tricolour streaks in the sky is going viral on social media with a false claim that it shows an Indian Air Force (IAF) display at the Dubai Air Show. BOOM found the claim to be false. The video is from an air show happened in Jesolo, Italy in June 2025 and has no relation to the recently concluded Dubai Air Show. The Dubai Air Show 2025 ended on a tragic note on November 21 when an Indian Air Force Tejas Mk 1 aircraft crashed mid display at Al Maktoum International Airport. The pilot, Wing Commander Naman Syal, lost his life in the crash at the age of 37.

Does This Viral Video Show Chennai Submerged After Cyclone Ditwah? No!,"A post circulating online shows a video of a narrow commercial street submerged in floodwater after intense monsoon rain. What’s the claim?: The post claims that the clip shows Chennai after Cyclone Ditwah. (Archives of similar posts can be found here and here.) Why is it being shared now?: Chennai and nearby districts have been experiencing persistent rainfall for several days due to Cyclone Ditwah, which has led to widespread waterlogging, flooding in multiple neighbourhoods, and traffic disruptions. What's the truth?: The claim is false. The video is from the Park Circus Seven Point Crossing area in Kolkata and dates back to September, when the city experienced heavy rainfall and severe waterlogging. What we found: We extracted keyframes from the video and ran them through Google Reverse Image Search. This led us to a Facebook post dated 25 September, which identified the location as Park Circus 7 Point Crossing in Kolkata. A keyword search further brought up multiple news reports, including one from the Hindustan Times, documenting the record-breaking rainfall in Kolkata on 22-23 September, which caused severe waterlogging across the city. These dates corroborate the timing of the original post. We also noted that several shop signs visible in the footage are in Bengali, contradicting the claim that the video shows Chennai. We ran the frames containing shopfronts through Google Reverse Image Search again, pointed to Park Circus, Ballygunge, Kolkata. Additionally, we matched one of the establishments, Royal Indian Restaurant, to its Google Street View location in the same area, confirming that the video was recorded in Kolkata, not Chennai. Conclusion: The claim that the video shows flooding in Chennai after Cyclone Ditwah is unrelated to the recent rainfall in Chennai.

Did India Issue a Letter to Pakistan Seeking Transfer of Imran Khan? No!,"A document purportedly issued by the Ministry of External Affairs is going viral on the internet to claim that the Indian government has requested Pakistan to send its former PM Imran Khan as a 'political prisoner'. What did the viral post say?: Those sharing the image have captioned it saying, ""Breaking News: Top secret letter of the Indian Ministery of External Affairs gets leaked on Social Media. Indian Government has requested Pakistan to send Imran Khan as a political prisoner to India just like Haseena Wajid (sic)."" This post had gained over 15 thousand views on the platform. Archives of similar such claims could be viewed here, here, and here. What's the truth?: There are several inconsistencies in the document, which raised doubts about its authenticity. Press Information Bureau's (PIB) fact-checking wing, too, clarified that the viral image was fake. Discrepancies in the viral document: A closer look at the document showed that it carried several inconsistencies, such as irregularities in fonts. In some paragraphs, one can notice spacing and font size errors. It is unlikely that an official document would contain such irregularities. No news reports or official records: Team WebQoof did not find any credible news reports or any information available in the public domain that supported the viral claim of India asking Pakistan to transfer Khan for his 'personal safety'. PIB debunks the claim: The fact-check wing of PIB, on its X account, said that the letter was ""fake"" and was not issued by the Ministry of External Affairs. The post shared on 1 December said, ""The claims being made in this letter are false, baseless, and part of an ongoing disinformation campaign being pushed by Pakistan against India."" ð¨ #PAKISTAN Propaganda Alert!Several Pakistani propaganda accounts are circulating a letter on social media, claiming it to be a top-secret Ministry of External Affairs document that allegedly leaked online.

iBomma Case: AI-Manipulated Video Viral as Ravi Immadi Showing Hacking in Court,"A video allegedly showing Ravi Immadhi, the accused and administrator of the iBomma movie-piracy network, in a courtroom is being shared on social media. In the clip, the man is seen using a laptop while detailing a ‘hacking procedure’ to a judge. The man is shown wearing a virtual reality (VR) headset during the alleged demonstration. (Archives of similar claims can be found here and here.) Is the claim true?: No, the claim is false as this video is manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI). The creator of the video confirmed to The Quint that the video was created with the help of AI. What we found: At first, we divided the clip into multiple screenshots and ran a Google reverse image search on some of them. It did not lead us to any reports or credible sources to prove the validity of the video. However, we noticed that the badge on the police personnel's uniform differed than the actual Telangana police logo. The reverse image search results led us to the same video on Instagram uploaded by Prajayhoney on 23 November. It noted, ""A video of iBomma Immadi Ravi performing a live hacking demo in court wearing a VR headset is going viral on social media. Ravi is clearly seen standing on the stand, typing on a laptop, and showing his hack proof in front of the judge. This shocking clip is being shared widely on social media through phone footage from the audience outside."" (sic.) We found a couple of more videos claiming to show Ravi being produced in court or the CCTV footage of his place on this Instagram profle. We contacted the Instagram user who confirmed that the video was created using AI. Here's what he told The Quint: Results by AI-detection tool: We ran it on AI-detection tool 'Deepfake-O-Meter,' where three of its detectors flagged the content as AI. The scores were ""100 per cent, 92.5 per cent and 99.9 per cent."" iBomma case: Hyderabad Cyber Crime Unit arrested Ravi Immadi, the alleged mastermind behind the iBomma and Bappam piracy network, which operated over 65 mirror sites and hosted nearly 21,000 pirated films. The racket drew millions of users monthly and also diverted visitors to illegal betting platforms, expanding its fraud operations. Conclusion: An AI-manipulated video claiming to show court proceedings of the iBomma case has gone viral on social media, as real.

AI Clips & Unrelated Images Shared as Recent Visuals of Cyclone in Sri Lanka,"A video, which shows an elephant rescuing a leopard, along with a photo of an under-constructed bridge submerged in water are going viral on social media platforms as recent visuals from Sri Lanka. The clip was shared with a caption that said, ""This is Heartbreaking to see. #FloodSL #FloodSriLanka."" The post on X had clocked over four lakh views on the platform. More archives of similar claims could be accessed here, here, and here. The image's caption said, ""BREAKING: Death toll from Cyclone Ditwah in Sri Lanka rises to 132, with 176 still missing. President declares state of emergency as nearly half a million people affected. India, US & Maldives rush humanitarian aid."" What are the facts?: The video has been generated using the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and does not show real visuals. The image of the under-constructed bridge dates back to September and is actually from Hyderabad. What about the video?: We noticed that the leopard's body appeared to disappear for a brief moment when the wild cat was seen readjusting on top of the elephant. Secondly, the texture of the water appeared too smooth. This is a trait that is commonly spotted in AI-generated visuals. What did detection tools show?: Team WebQoof passed the video through two AI detection tools namely — 'Hive Moderation' and 'DeepFake-O-Meter' to further verify the authenticity. While the first tool showed around 89 percent probability, one detector of the second tool showed about 100 percent chance of the video being an AI-generated one. Swipe right to view all screenshots. (Source: Hive Moderation/Screenshot) About the viral image?: On conducting a reverse image search on the viral photo, we found a video uploaded on the official X handle of media outlet Deccan Chronicle. It was shared on 27 September with a caption saying, ""#Hyderabad | Heavy rains raise Musi river levels. Authorities begin evacuation from low lying areas."" #Hyderabad | Heavy rains raise Musi river levels. Authorities begin evacuation from low lying areas.#Telangana pic.twitter.com/v2DjEkJxMD Conclusion: It is evident that the visuals are being incorrectly shared as from Sri Lanka.

Video of BSF IG Admitting Failure in Counter-Terrorism Operations Is Deepfake,"A video of BSF IG, Kashmir Frontier, Ashok Yadav, talking about how the forces have neutralised zero terrorists is going viral on social media platforms as a real statement.

""We have achieved zero on counter terrorism because the centre government is refusing to provide us with our procurement budgets and funds, we are absolutely failing.""."" The above post had gained over a lakh views on the platform. More archives of similar claims could be found here, here, and here. What's the truth?: The video has been manipulated using the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and does not show any real remarks made by Yadav.

Is the Karnataka Deputy CM DK Shivakumar Moving to NDA Amid Power Tussle? No!,"A post is going viral on social media with a clip of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu and Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister Doddalahalli Kempegowda (DK) Shivakumar talking privately at the airport. In the clip, both leaders gesture for their security staff to move aside before engaging in a brief conversation, which is being framed as a ""secret political meeting"". What's the claim?: The viral post claims that Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar is preparing to leave the Congress and join the National Democratic Alliance, suggesting that the Congress government in Karnataka is on the verge of collapse. (Archives of similar posts can be found here and here.) Why is it being shared?: The video has surfaced after the Congress government in Karnataka crossed its halfway mark, reviving talk about the reported power-sharing agreement. Under the agreement, Siddaramaiah would lead the government in the first half of the term, and DK Shivakumar would take over in the second half. There were reports about a power tussle between the two, with many social media users exaggerating these internal tensions into claims that Shivakumar is being courted by the NDA. What's the truth?: The claim is false. The video is not recent. It was recorded on 28 December 2023 at Bengaluru HAL Airport when Chandrababu Naidu and DK Shivakumar accidentally ran into each other while travelling separately. What we found: We extracted keyframes from the viral video and ran them through Google’s reverse image search. This led us to the original clip posted by ANI’s official X account, dated 28 December 2023. #WATCH | DK Shivakumar, Karnataka Deputy CM met former CM of Andhra Pradesh and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu at HAL airport in Bengaluru, earlier today pic.twitter.com/dLamRjf0I9 A keyword search further took us to a news report by ABP Desam, also published on 28 December 2023, which reported on the run-in. According to the report, Naidu was returning to Kuppam after visiting a party worker in Bengaluru, while Shivakumar was headed to another location on a different flight. We also scanned recent political coverage and found no reports indicating that DK Shivakumar is in talks with the NDA or planning to defect from the Congress. Conclusion: The claim that a recent secret meeting between Chandrababu Naidu and DK Shivakumar points to a plot to topple the Karnataka government is false. The video is from December 2023 and shows a brief, incidental airport encounter. (Not convinced of a post or information you came across online and want it verified?

Fact-Check: Does This Clip Show Dharmendra Deol’s Final Journey? No!,"A viral post circulating on social media shares a clip of a large crowd accompanying a funeral procession, claiming it shows the final journey of veteran Bollywood actor Dharmendra Kewal Krishan Deol. He was one of Hindi cinema’s most iconic stars, had a career spanning six decades and acted in over 300 films. He passed away on 24 November 2025 due to age-related illness after a period of declining health. What's the claim?: The post claims that the viral clip shows Dharmendra’s final journey, with lakhs of grieving admirers lining the streets to pay homage during his last rites. (Archive of a similar post can be found here.) What's the truth?: The claim is false. The viral clip does not show Dharmendra’s funeral procession. It is actually from the final journey of Zubeen Garg, the Indian singer and composer who died in a scuba diving accident on 19 September. What we found: We ran the key frames from the viral video through Google’s reverse image search. It led us to a longer version of the clip posted on news organisation CNN-News 18's YouTube page. The video shows the visuals are from the funeral procession of singer Zubeen Garg in Guwahati on 19 September, after he died in a scuba diving accident. We also reviewed reports by Moneycontrol and North East News from 21 September, which show identical visuals of the crowd, vehicle and floral setup, confirming the clip is from Zubeen Garg’s final journey and not Dharmendra’s. A YouTube livestream of Dharmendra’s funeral shows a peaceful cremation ceremony with no large street procession, confirming that the viral clip is unrelated. The visuals, context, crowd, location, and date are completely different from Dharmendra’s last rites, which were held at the Pawan Hans Crematorium in Mumbai. Conclusion: The viral claim that the clip shows Dharmendra’s final journey is misleading. The footage is from Zubeen Garg’s funeral procession in Guwahati, not from Dharmendra’s last rites.

Does This Video Show RSS-Linked Groups Attack Christians at Catholic School? No!,"A post is going viral on social media with a clip showing a crowd violently scrambling over cartons of packaged snacks. What's the claim?: The post claims that the men in the video are Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) extremists who allegedly attacked St Mother Teresa Catholic School in Mancherial district of Telangana. (Archives of similar posts can be found here and here.) What's the truth?: The claim is false. The clip is actually from Hamirpur, Uttar Pradesh. While an incident involving an alleged attack on St Mother Teresa School in Mancherial did occur on 18 April, the viral clip circulating online is not footage of that event. What we found: We ran the key frames from the video through Google's reverse image search. It led us to a longer version of the clip, which shows the incident took place in Hamirpur, Uttar Pradesh, during a mass wedding event on 27 November 2025. We also reviewed several news articles from 27 November 2025 that show the exact same visuals and confirm that the video is from Uttar Pradesh, not Telangana. An NDTV news coverage reports that the clip depicts a chaotic moment during a mass wedding ceremony in Uttar Pradesh, where attendees rushed to snatch free snack packets. An incident involving an extremist attack in St Mother Teresa Catholic School in Mancherial has occurred but it took place on 18 April 2024, according to an NDTV report. The visuals, context, crowd, location, and date are completely different. A YouTube video of the Mancherial school attack shows different people, location and events, confirming that the viral clip is unrelated. Conclusion: The viral post wrongly claims that a video from a chaotic mass wedding in Uttar Pradesh shows extremists attacking a Catholic school in Telangana. The two events are unconnected, differ in location, date, visuals, and context, and the claim is entirely false. (Not convinced of a post or information you came across online and want it verified?

Did Raveena Tandon’s Daughter Rasha Thadani Win the 2025 World Boxing Cup? No!,"A video of a a woman speaking to the media about winning a gold medal is being widely shared on social media. In the clip, she speaks about her previous championship and how she is proud to represent India on a global stage. The claim: Some users sharing the clip have claimed that it shows former actor Raveena Tandon’s daughter Rasha Thadani winning the gold medal in the 2025 Boxing Cup finals in the 80+kg category. This claim was also shared by media organisation Sudarshan News North East’s Instagram account, where it was liked by more than 17,500 users. (Archives of more posts sharing this claim can be seen here and here.) Is it true?: No, the claim is false. The video shows boxer Noopur Sheoran, not Rasha Thadani. How do we know?: We ran a reverse image search on the video, which led us to an Instagram post, that had shared the same video. It identified the woman in the video as Nupur Sheoran, the winner of the 2025 World Boxing Cup Finals. Since the video bore news agency ANI’s logo, we looked for the video on their social media accounts. They too, had shared this video on 16 September as one of Sheoran talking about winning the silver, and hoping to win the World Cup in November 2025. #WATCH | Delhi | On winning Silver medal at the World Boxing Championship 2025, Nupur Sheoran says, ""It feels great to have brought a medal for the country... I will bring gold for the country in the World Cup that will happen in November..."" pic.twitter.com/owaFxjSUId On comparing photos of Sheoran and Thadani, who is an actor, one can see that they are not see the same person. 2025 Boxing World Cup: On 20 November 2025, Sheoran defeated Uzbekistan’s Sotimboeva Oltinoy 5-0 in the Women’s 80+ kg category to clinch the gold medal. Conclusion: A video of boxer Nupur Sheoran is being shared on social media where users have misidentified her as Raveena Tandon’s daughter, Rasha Thadani.

AI-Generated Clip Viral as Indian Soldier Being 'Scared' of Pakistan Army,"A video circulating on social media showing individuals dressed in military uniforms, purportedly from the Indian Army, criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and describing the Pakistani army as ""dangerous"", is being shared on social media. In the clip, the individuals plead to PM Modi and the Indian government to save them. Here's what they said: (Archives of similar claims can be found here and here.) Is the claim true?: No, the claim is false as this video is created using artificial intelligence (AI) tools. What we found: At first, we divided the clip into multiple screenshots to find if it had been reported on by any credible news outlet or government agency. However, we did not find any sources to prove the validity of the viral clip. Team WebQoof, then, ran a relevant keyword search to find if there had been a recent incident like the viral video. However, we did not find the desired results. Anomalies in the clip: We noticed that the lip movement and the words being spoken in the clip did not match and seemed very mechanical in nature. Similarly, the placement of the national flag seemed strange on the alleged soldier's uniform. Additionally, in the second frame, the person did not blink once throughout the video. AI-detection tool: We ran the viral video on Hive Moderation which revealed that the video was created using AI. Conclusion: The viral video is created using AI and is not real, as claimed.

Rajdeep Sardesai Interview,"""How can we as journalists normalise hate? How can we? I can understand some extremist voices doing it. We are supposed to provide guidance. We are supposed to be a moral compass. And yes, social media has worsened it. But television media also has much to answer for. I am not going to stand here and claim I am different. I am a part of that wider television mainstream media. We are also at fault,"" said senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai, as he spoke about communal narratives being run by India's 'mainstream media'. In his latest book - 'The Election that Surprised India' - the last chapter talks about the 'compromised 'state of Indian media, the accusations of biases, and the fear in India's media industry. At the same time, the book largely talks about the 2024 general elections, Sardesai's own experiences covering elections over the years, anecdotes from his encounters with political personalities, and the way forward for India as a nation. On 'Badi Badi Baatein', Rajdeep Saresai spoke to scores of journalists from The Quint, along with Eshwar, about all this and more! The election that surprised India, it obviously surprised India but over 36 years of your career, you have covered so many elections. Which election did you find the most interesting and why? Each election is very special. As a bit of a nostalgia buff, the first election always matters. I remember 1989, covering VP Singh as he was going on a road show through Mumbai. I was very excited. And, you know, that was the 'Battle of Bofors.' That was also the first election, by the way, where the BJP emerged. And I think that was fascinating. In 1991, Rajiv Gandhi's assassination... bang in the middle of the elections. That changed the complexion of that poll. In terms of surprises, I would say 2004 and this election in 2024, were the two surprises in terms of outcomes. So, you'd have to measure these two. I don't think anyone expected Mr Vajpayee to not become Prime Minister in 2004. I think everyone expected the BJP to win big in 2024. And neither happened. I think Mr. Modi can claim that at least, unlike Mr. Vajpayee, he's not out of power. But just think about it, had Odish — it's one of the what-ifs — if Odisha had not voted the way they were, which was primarily because of the Pandyan factor, and had Nitish Kumar remained within the India Alliance, you could have had a very different election in 2024. So, I think these two surprised me. But every election, I find some joy or the other in every Indian election. It's a great chance to go out, meet people and find out what the voter wants. Let's give Mr. Modi credit also, because this year, most incumbents across the world have lost. 65 elections were held across the world, across democracies. And more than 50 of the incumbents have lost. So, Mr. Modi survived. And therefore, it's a very strange election. He survived. In a strange way, the Opposition also survived. So, we're not sure who won and who lost. I like to say in the book that the voter won. I think the good news is, this is still the most diverse country in the world at the moment. So, what is true about one part of the country may not be true of the other. I mean, in all the focus on Maharashtra, we've forgotten that the BJP lost Jharkhand. Right? And Hemant Soren scored a big victory. In all the focus on Haryana, we forgot the fact that in Jammu and Kashmir, the Opposition won. Like you said, it's difficult to say who won and who lost the 2024 general election. And there was something very interesting that Mr. Chidambaram said at the launch of the book, that the electorate has largely moved right. But there is also a school of thought which thinks that the Opposition's performance was in fact a pushback to this fact that the electorate has moved right. Which one do you think it is? Make no mistake, Eshwar, I think politics has moved to the right in this country. By and large, like it or not, the BJP is the dominant party of this country. Today, they are in power in more than a dozen states of this country on their own, and with their allies, a few more. And those are big numbers. You know, the fact is that the BJP consistently has scored big in some of the major states of the country. They have been in power in UP twice. They've been the number one party in Maharashtra three consecutive elections. They've been in power or power sharing in Bihar, barring small spells when Nitish does a somersault. And Mr Modi is a three-time Prime Minister, the first since Jawaharlal Nehru. So, the centre of gravity of Indian politics has shifted to the right. But I still think India is far too diverse to suggest that the BJP is a hegemonic party that can win elections in every corner of India unlike the Congress in the past. In the 60s in particular, Congress would triumph in every corner of India. The BJP still finds it difficult to truly penetrate the Deep South. It still has resistance in pockets of the East. But it is party number one and that's not changing for a while. The BJP said they will go '400 paar', that obviously did not happen. But despite the mandate that they have, nothing has really changed. Everybody said they will be more mellow, etc. But nothing has really changed. They are as fierce as they used to be. In fact, they have started fighting elections more strongly and that is being cited as one of the reasons behind the Haryana and Maharashtra wins. Many people call it the victory of Hindutva. Do you think it is that? Look, I don't think any one factor decides elections in India anymore. Firstly, let me say this — This is the most relentless, ruthless and remorseless election machinary in the history of post-independent India, and resource rich. You have everything. You know, like the 'Deewar' dialogue,""Mere paas maa hai!"" I sometimes wonder what the opposition does have. The BJP is like a Ferrari and the Congress is like a Fiat when you look at the two purely as machines, there is no comparison at the moment. So, you got to keep that in mind when you raise this question about the BJP and Hindutva. Hindutva is one element of it. A friend of mine had a nice word — 'Hind.' H for Hindutva, I for infrastructure, N for nationalism, and D for delivery. And somewhere in these four boxes, you find something which might make the BJP attractive today. One of the tragedies of this country in the last 30 years and particularly since I have covered this, you know, this period in time has been how we have normalised this politics of Hindu majoritarianism. “The one who talks about Hindu interests will rule the country”, was what I heard when I joined journalism in ‘88-’89, in that '89 campaign. That time we thought it was a marginal force. Now, 35 years later, I hear even polite society saying, ""It’s a Hindu party, it’s a Hindu party..."" And nobody seems to object in the room. They seem to be okay with the fact that this is a Hindu country. That's the change that's taken place. And the BJP... the very forces that rose in ‘89 and beyond are the ones who are ruling us today. I mean, Narendra Modi and my are careers parallel in a way. He's, of course, gone up there. That's the only difference. I met him in 1990 for the first time at the Rath Yatra. And if you had asked me then that he'd be a three-time Prime Minister, I don't think I'd say yes. But, look, I think he has been able to capture this zeitgeist, if I may use that word, this mood for change, and this assertion of a Hindu identity much more than any other leader in this period has. And that's his success. So, you mean the politics of the fringes that you saw at the beginning of your career has now become mainstream? Absolutely! I think if Yogi Adityanath was doing politics in ‘89, we would have called him a fringe figure. He's now mainstream. I remember when Bal Thackeray would talk in this language, he had judicial verdicts being imposed against him. He was even banned by the courts. Contrast that with today, we have far more vile, direct, hateful speeches being made. And people get away with it time and again. And I think that normalisation has brought the fringe to the mainstream. That's worrying. Talking about the Haryana and Maharashtra results, like you said, there is narrative, there is sympathy, there are lots of factors other than Hindutva. To an extent, for example, in a state like Maharashtra, these factors for the Opposition were very strong. The impact of which was seen in the Lok Sabha elections of Maharashtra. What do you think went so massively wrong in six months with the Opposition's narrative, the sympathy factor for Mr Pawar and Aditya Thackeray, the vote jihad narrative that Mr Fadnavis drove so strongly... Where did the Opposition fall short in Maharashtra and Haryana in six months' time? Maharashtra is interesting because while you look at it, the Opposition won 30 Lok Sabha seats out of 48 and the BJP-led Alliance 17. In vote share, they were the same, right? So, there was no major change in vote share. And I think sometimes the biggest mistake, the biggest problem for the Opposition is that the moment they win, they think ""Our time has come..."" Forgetting that every election is different to the other. You have to work at it. The BJP worked and the courese was corrected. They brought in Ladki Bahin Yojana, they opened the treasuries of Maharashtra. All kinds of schemes were announced, many of which involved direct cash benefits, like with Ladki Bahin, Rs 1500 rupees a month, Rs 7500 by October, including Diwali bonus. I mean, every woman I met, no one had a bad word to say about Eknath Shinde. In April-May, I met a lot of people who said, ''Khoke ki sarkaar."" Nobody talked about it this time. That's how you change the narrative. The stories of these 12,000 booths that they focused on, made every effort through Mahila Vistaraks, through holding small corner meetings, that level of micro planning, I don't think the opposition could match. Opposition through July-August-September spent all the time deciding who will become the chief minister, when they should have had a counter ready to Ladki Bahin, and gone harder perhaps at the flaws in the Shinde government, which are many. The very fact that you need to give Rs 1500 means that there is distress on the ground. So, you needed to push your own narrative equally strongly. I think the Opposition made the cardinal mistake that all parties made this year which was overconfidence. Narendra Modi ji and the BJP were slightly overconfident of 2024 Lok Sabha, paid a price. Bhoopinder Singh Hooda and the Congress were very confident, even deciding on portfolios already, lost out in Haryana. And the same thing happened in Maharashtra. There is no place for complacency in politics now. This is very competitive. It's aggressive plus money power boss. A lot of money has come in. Because we’re talking about a level playing field. Every time an election concludes and the Opposition loses the narrative of EVMs, vote rigging, EVM tampering comes into play. Do you think EVMs can be tampered or manipulated or rigged or messed around with in this country? Look, I am not a technical man, so I am not going to go into the technicalities of it. But two points — One, most importantly, the Election Commission in this country has lost credibility. So, people think the worst about them. People feel, something must be wrong with this election because we have lost all faith in institutions. I liken it in the book to Pakistan's umpires. In the 1980s, even if the Pakistan umpire was a good umpire, we thought he is a cheat. So, the part of the problem with the Election Commission is perceptional. The BJP will say that during Congress's time, the Election Commission wasn't any different, which may also be true. And Congress people will think the worst. But I am thinking of middle ground. Democratically-minded citizens have a huge problem with EC. On EVMs specifically, there are experts who are talking about the symbol loading unit. And while the EVM is an independent unit and therefore they say cannot be hacked, it's not connected to some wider WiFi internet, the VVPAT and the symbol loading unit could be possibly used. Now, unless we have an independent, and I stress the word 'independent' group of experts monitoring this, and doing a proper audit after every election... Is there any shortage in this country of top people who can audit? You will get the EVMs audited often by the same people who have themselves made the EVMs. Get it done by neutral, independent experts. Separate the milk from the water. Look, today the Opposition sometimes uses EVMs to cover up their own incompetence. ""We lost the election, the EVM cheated us."" And public doesn't believe the Opposition. By and large, while many people don't trust the EVMs, they also don't want you to be seen crying every time you lose an election. Speaking of the integrity of the Election Commission — we have perhaps given up on the hope that action will be taken on hate speeches under the MCC (Model Code of Conduct). But there are other things, like for example, what we saw in Kundarki recently in the UP by-polls, people being stopped from voting, people being threatened from voting. When issues like these are not addressed by the Election Commission head-on, the Opposition keeps raising those issues and nobody is there to listen, the judiciary is not really seen taking any cognisance, the appointment of the Election Commission of India has largely been watered down and diluted. What is the way out of this for the common voters? Look, I think you've hit the nail on that. It's not EVMs. To my mind, the first thing has to start with voter lists. The name, the manner in which voters' names are added and deleted. This is a major issue. It needs a proper audit again. You are absolutely right. All these questions we raise, but the institution that should act as checks and balances are not. The Supreme Court, frankly, just doesn't seem to want to get into any issue where they may have to challenge the government's view. So, the Supreme Court has by and large been supine or has absolutely abdicated what I think its responsibility should be. Get an audit done. Because only when the Supreme Court says it will the ECI listen. Like it was with electoral bonds. It required the Supreme Court for them to wake up to electoral bonds and what could go wrong with them. Otherwise, we would have carried on as business as usual. So, Supreme Court needs to intervene. Someone needs to wake up the Supreme Court. We will have to shake them. Second, the media sometimes when I say this, people tell me, ""What are you doing?"" They are right. But you know, I am not the Election Commission of India. I can only point out what needs to be done. And I think the Opposition also is going to have to find a better way in which they can take their case. It is not easy being an Opposition leader in India, having said that. We criticise the Opposition a lot and ask them questions. But what can they do? I am not saying the ballot box is the way forward. I was there as a young journalist and I covered an election in the early 90s in Mumbai where ballot boxes were being stuffed in front of us. We took photographs. It was pre TV, so we took photographs. The election was countermanded. It’s not as if everything was fine during the time of ballot boxes. But at least we need to have some transparency. You know, I am going to come back to the question on media. But before that I want to get to a very huge weapon that the current regime uses and this particular party uses — It's the othering of minorities and specifically Muslims. For the past 10 years we have seen narratives like Gau Raksha, cow vigilantism, love jihad... Corona jihad! In this country, there was a Corona jihad. I have said it in my book. Can you imagine that you are holding some tablighis responsible to be corona carriers and vegetable vendors were not allowed in the houses as a result. And when the kumbh mela takes place I have given the full description of that in the book.The Kumbh Mela happens just before the COVID wave. With the chief minister and all nobody observing social distancing. Did anyone call them 'corona carriers'? The Prime minister and other leaders are addressing rallies. All parties — Prime Minister, Mamata Banerjee addressing rallies in Bengal. Did anyone call them corona carriers? Right. And at the same time when this is something which is being propagated politically, we also see the social repercussions of it. We have seen so many instances in the recent past where Muslims are being denied housing. It's not that it had not been happening but to make it happen so blatantly! The BJP has not fielded any single Lok Sabha candidate, the Congress in Lok Sabha of Maharashtra did not field a single Muslim candidate. So, do you think the secular parties failed to stand up for Muslims? You know there are two perspectives. Let's look at it from both perspectives. One is the secular perspective. Clearly, secular parties, as you rightly said, have perhaps failed to offer a consistent challenge to the march of Hindutva. And they have run with the secular hare and hunted with the communal hound. I mean it again goes back to that first election 1989. Rajiv Gandhi started his campaign from Ayodhya in 1989. And over the years, every attempt was made in a way to placate extremist views on all sides. And we have paid a price today. A lot of the problems of today go back to 1989 since the time I started journalism, in a way. I have seen the manner in which secular parties have exposed themselves. Over the last 30-35 years. But that is a story well known. They have exposed themselves. They did play vote bank politics. The Shah Bano judgement was a good example of playing vote bank politics, or a bad example rather of playing vote bank politics which was exploited by the BJP to emerge out of two seats in 1984. So, there is a dark history of playing communal politics of instigating one group against the other in a way. But I also think that let's not use that as an excuse or alibi for what communal politics has done. Yes, secular politics has failed, agreed! Does that justify the rise or the normalisation of communal politics or the toxic politics that we are seeing at times play out in this country? Does it justify as you rightly said the manner in which Muslims can feel victimised and demonised consistently? Does it justify that? There has been a concerted attempt to normalise the worst form of communal politics. In which political parties have played a role, civil society has played a role, social media, the media has played a role. And it's very tragic. Courts have allowed it to pass. Institutions have completely abdicated their responsibilities. So, there are no checks and balances. Someone can call for an economic boycott of a community today in a particular part of the country and no one is going to say a word against that person. And therefore, I think that secular politics' failure is a given... Let's say it's a given. As you've given examples. But something more than that has happened. The rise of assertive Hindutva is not an answer to let's say minority extremism. Reject both forms of extremism I am saying. Let's be honest. Even after 1947 these forces have existed. It was Nehru and Patel. We often forget that. Even Vallabhbhai today is appropriated. But Vallabhbhai was very clear. He is Gandhi's disciple, Vallabhbhai is not Godse's disciple. Pushed to the test, Vallabhbhai would never allow someone to be killed on the basis of their religion. Today, you have allowed that to happen in this country. In the name of Love Jihad, in the name of Gau Raksha, even Corona Jihad was used to discriminate... Land Jihad, love jihad... no more kinds of jihad are left now. But at the same time hasn't the media also played a huge part in propagating these narratives. For example, I do not see any mainstream media anchor or senior journalist in this country, who are largely with the TV media right now, standing up for people like Mohammad Zubair or Sidheeq Kappan. If a Shraddha Walkar case happens, the religion of the perpetrator makes it a sensitive story but when an equally gruesome crime happens somewhere else, it is not talked about. So, do you not think the so called mainstream media today is also feeding off of the hate that is clearly selling? Two things. First of all, you are now asking a question which is deeply, which is pushing me into an ethical mind field (laughs). And who is to say who is mainstream? But you know I write in this book openly. I'll be honest, when I wrote that last chapter on the media, I was wondering if should I write it while I am in the media! Because how honest can you be? I have tried to be honest. Siddiqui Kappan you mentioned, I have a full thing about him in the book. Umar Khalid, Zubair,and others... You are absolutely right! A terrible rape takes place at RG KAR, God forbid if the rapist was a Muslim, God forbid! Look at what would have happened. Terrible gang rapes take place in different parts of the country. Are we going to define the scale of the crime based on the religion of the perpetrator? I mean there can be nothing more awful than that. And yes, you are absolutely right, the mainstream media has fed into this narrative. And that is where my anger and disillusionment with the media comes. How can we as journalists normalise hate? How can we? I can understand some extremist voices doing it. We are supposed to provide guidance. We are supposed to be a moral compass. And yes, social media has worsened it. But television media also has much to answer for. I am not going to stand here and claim I am different. I am a part of that wider television mainstream media. We are also at fault. Maybe I have failed. I accept it. And in my darker moments I have wondered what the hell am I doing because this is where you draw the line. You do what you want to do, bash Pakistan, whatever you want to do, go ahead. But where you draw the line is against your own people. And you pit people one against the other based on these completely flawed notions of religious identity. I mean, you used the right example of crime. Basic crime is committed. How can the perpetrator's religious identity put the entire community in the dock? How can I blame a community for something that happened 300-400 years ago, when a temple was destroyed and a mosque was built? Am I responsible for what happened 400 years ago when you say 'descendants of Babur'? What is this? And again, in ‘89 when I heard this 'Descendants of Babur' phrase, I thought these were all fringe elements. Maybe something went wrong with my education. These days, they say, you went to a very liberal education. Even being a liberal today is seen as a curse. ""You are anti-national, you are supporting Umar Khalid...' But look at it, Eshwar. An Umar Khalid for four and a half years, nobody stands up for him, right? In the case, which is a very weak case. I mean, I have gone through it in the book. And it's a weak case. Now, contrast it with my friend Arnab Goswami. Courts opened up for him on a Saturday to get bail. He should also get bail, it definitely should be given. Bail not jail should be the norm whether you are Arnab Goswami, whether you are Mohammad Zubair, whether you are Disha Ravi. Please think about it. I was very disturbed when I got sedition charges put against me in 2021. Then I met Disha Ravi. And I looked at this small girl and I said, how can they call her an anti-national? That the great Delhi police which supposed to be the best police in the country at one time goes all the way to Bangalore to pick her up. Saying, she is part of our tool kit. What is this? They’ve made a joke of the country! There was someone else who had FIRs filed against him for exposing a midday meal scheme in Uttar Pradesh. Look at the Kashmiri journalists. They are in jail, many of them under Public Safety Act, where you don't even get out for a year or two. It's terrible! Nobody talks about them. Nobody talks what Siddiqui Kappan and his family went through, which I have documented in the book. These are the stories that make you angry. You know, as I said, we should always be angry. I think journalists get angry over the wrong things. We get angry when a leader doesn’t give an interview. Oh, let the leader go to hell! If he doesn’t give an interview, then don’t give it. The real anger should be directed from the real issues. Talking about media bias, you are probably one of the senior most journalists that we know, who has seen the boom of TV news, the rise of TV news, the fall, the plateau, everything. At times, there are anchors, journalists also from your network who are accused of bias. On a scale of one to being almost a PR body, where do you see TV journalism as a whole today in this country? Firstly, 'biased' is a problematic term. If I call someone else biased, they will also turn it around and point the finger at me, saying, 'You're biased.' I don't even like using terms like 'godi media' or 'darbari media' because these words only divide us further. We need to ask ourselves, are we doing enough to question those in power? Are we being driven by fear? For example, look at Dainik Bhaskar. They did an excellent story exposing how bodies were floating in the Ganga during the COVID crisis. The very strong image they shared. Within a week or two, they were raided. The ED and IT came after them. Who defended them? I also talk about Prannoy Roy. We owe so much to people like him for their foresight and entrepreneurship. He’s a big name. Imagine, he was stopped at the airport, like a criminal with a lookout notice. In this country, the real criminals are never touched, but Prannoy Roy was targeted. Later, the immigration officer who stopped him met me on a flight and said the orders came from the top. After ED and CBI raids, he was repeatedly summoned. And in 2022, the company was taken over by Adani. One of India’s original TV companies was taken over! Today, who is protesting this? In any other country, there would have been pushback. There must be a pushback. If this can happen to Prannoy Roy, imagine what happens to smaller people. Look at Newsclick. They even confiscated young interns' mobile phones and laptops. Where is the protest? Even after the killing of Gauri Lankesh, there wasn’t a stronger stand taken by people. If we don’t stand up, the leaders will crush us. The public knows all this. Why are YouTube channels becoming so popular? Because people are tired of the mainstream. They want something new, something different. There must be truth told to power. For example, between 2009 and 2014, we exposed the Manmohan Singh government. But today, what’s happening? Even we were onw of the firms raided in 2018. Yes, what happened to Raghav Bahl is extremely unfortunate. I worked very closely with Raghav. I owe him a huge debt from Network 18 days. He too suddenly found himself being targeted in that manner that. And what happened in Prannoy Roy's case, and probably will happen in Raghav's case - the CBI says, now we have no evidence. We have nothing. So, you stopped the person from going abroad, raided his house, called him in, took over his company. And now you say, 'We have nothing'! Networks as big as yours have the resources to be able to go against those in power. But media houses as small as ours may not have as many resources to push back. Do you think now it is upon teh subscribers to go towards a paid news subscription model? You mentioned India Today earlier as well... The very fact that India Today has had me for 10 years on a prime time show means there has been pushback. It can't be easy to have a Rajdeep Sardesai... Would you want to elaborate on that? No no (laughs)! They have given me more space than I could have imagined. And therefore, I am very grateful to India Today in that sense. And I think that's the advantage of having owners whose primary business is journalism. They can push back and do more. But at the same time, when I see some of India's biggest media houses, many of them will not even cover or touch this book because they will be fearful of what will happen. Ironically, a senior BJP leader called me up, I won’t name him. He said, 'What an incredible book you have written.' I told him, 'Sir, will you say that publicly?' He said. 'We will talk about this later'. But I was very happy to hear that. Because I know that he is someone who genuinely reads books. He did not say this just for show. He has nothing to gain from me, nor do I from him. But, you know, bigger media houses, you are right, have to show the light. If they don't, paid news and subscriptions the way forward? Indians don’t want to pay for news. They want everything for free. You know, the world is built on hope. Now, think about it, what kind of country is this? A 26-year-old Sanjana Jatav. You did our story on The Quint too. But there is also space here for new voices, a new voice of change. Something is in the air in this country. I still live in hope. I hope I see that new dawn soon, where I see many more voices, especially in the media. But I am very impressed with all of you young people. I feel you all have more energy than my generation. We were still conformists compared to you. You know, since you found more young people to work for you, the salary was Rs. 800, but at that time, working with you was the real price Yes, the HR manager had said that. I asked him, 'Won't you give a little more?' And he replied, 'Come on, you're working for Times of India.'"" But that doesn't work for younger generations. The pay parity and work environment are the biggest issues for young students seeking to come to the industry. Look, I think younger journalists will face that challenge. You see, television changed it for us. When we went into print, it wasn’t like there was a lot of money. We went into print because of our passion. I could have been a lawyer, and I probably should have been one. I would have probably earned as much as Dr. Abhishek Manu Singh before. For adjournments, he charges a few lakhs. Forget that. But journalism was never a high-paying profession. TV changed it. Now, the next generation has to build it through digital. You've got technology, and it's both a double-edged sword. The challenge is, how do you build a revenue model around digital, not just in India but globally? But I think solutions will come. I think there is no substitute for good content. Bad content, I think, will increasingly find no takers anymore. You know, nobody is going to just switch on to see six people shouting at each other. That format has gone, in my view. It’s something they still do, out of necessity. But I think even that is going to change Who has the most interesting political interview off-camera? Bal Thackeray was interesting. Because I was a young journalist growing up in Mumbai, he was this larger-than-life figure. And the first time I met him, he said, 'Forget the interview, first have a warm beer with me.' I said, here I am, ready for the interview, prepared with 10-12 questions. And he says, 'Have a warm beer with me.' I remember when I first interviewed Lalu Prasad, he said, 'No, this interview won’t happen here.' We had set up in the Chief Minister's bungalow. He took us to the cow shelter, saying, 'This interview will happen here.' I think, long before Narendra Modi, Lalu also understood the power of the television image. Both of them are like that. They understand the power of the image. The one who really impressed me as a human was Nelson Mandela. I mean, there is something about Nelson Mandela that struck me. I never saw Gandhi. But if there is one person I thought, this person must have had something similar to Mahatma Gandhi, it was him. Over the years, I’ve been privileged to meet many. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, even in his pauses, there was something. LK Advani was extremely combative. There have been many politicians over the years in different forms. Narendra Modi was good interviewee. We had one or two good interviews. If he gives me an interview, we'll break the internet!

Manoj Bajpayee Interview,"Actor Manoj Bajpayee sits down with The Quint in the latest installment of ‘Tell Me All’ to talk about his early days in the industry, working in Satya, why he believes the film fraternity is fragmented, how his wife has influenced his career and much more. Speaking of finding work during his early days in the industry, Bajpayee said, “It was very difficult to be found out by the production people; it was very difficult to meet anyone on set if you weren’t part of the unit. There was no casting director’s office; it was almost impossible to find work. Word of mouth was more important than anything else.” He went on to talk about his wife’s influence, “If I could freely move around it was because of her support. She has complete faith in me and she is also my biggest critic. She doesn’t want me to enjoy the laurels a second longer than needed; she wants me to be realistic about everything.” Bajpayee talks about why he is indebted to filmmakers Ram Gopal Varma and Shekhar Kapur, what the film industry is like for independent filmmakers, the importance of social responsibility as an artist, shooting the nude scene in Despatch and much more.

Minorities in Bangladesh,"There are situations where all the parties involved would instinctively know what is unfolding, without necessarily knowing why or how. Even more debilitating is the knowledge that it would unfold irrespective of what they do or don’t do. All they can do is hope to delay the inevitable and prepare for a hard landing — which they may or may not survive in good shape, if at all. Let’s begin with an illustrative incident. On 11 December, Dhaka Tribune reported that a group called Muslim Consumers’ Rights Council demanded a ban, and boycott too, on restaurants that don’t serve beef. This unremarkable small gathering remarkably points to the heart of the beast. ""Although eating camel meat is not obligatory, it became essential for a Muslim due to its connection to Jewish dietary laws. Similarly, in the context of Hindu beliefs, consuming beef becomes a declaration of faith for Muslims,"" the convenor of the protesting organisation reasoned. Along with actual atrocities committed against minorities, increasing acceptance of such quasi-political theological reasoning among the majority population and its blunt articulation by the radical outfits amply demonstrate where the country is headed. If the idea of beef festivals was a progressive invention in India, it is being reinvented as a weapon of the majority in Bangladesh. While violence and aggression have been a part of Bangladesh's politics ever since the 1971 liberation war, these episodes are of a different character – because the norms of Bangladeshi politics have changed. The pattern of politics after a revolutionary shake-up can be illustrated with a metaphor from natural sciences. Once the fervent period of overthrow and capture of power is over, the polity cools and crystallises into a new structure with the least possible entropy. Parties, social groups, and institutions realign themselves so that they occupy advantageous positions within the new social order. Normal politics resumes, but in a new guise and under new norms. Today, persecution is in the Bangladeshi air. Both the minorities and the Islamists – would-be victims and the perpetrators – distinctly recognise this possibility, this new norm. Under the Awami League regime, the political hegemony built against the 1971 genocide meant that such a thought remained impermissible in the social realm. Any expression of genocidal intent or apologetics would result in a swift reprisal from the state. With the collapse of the League regime, this hegemonic grip has loosened. Moreover, the question of persecution has now shifted from the political realm to the social. In other words, the ‘axis of happening’ has shifted from the political to the social. In this situation, the initiative for radicalisation comes from the grassroots level. A general attitude of persecution, which could lead either to expulsion or destruction of the one-crore plus minority population in the country, has taken root in Bangladesh at the societal level. Understanding this shift is key to appreciating the dilemma of the Muhammad Yunus government. The Yunus government certainly has no agenda, or ideological inclinations, for persecuting the minorities: however, they also don't have the political resonance to spot these tremors. Liberal governments tend to think that a society is free from the politics of persecution as long as state machinery is not involved, either passively or actively. Such a viewpoint mistakenly sees persecution as either an act of commission or omission by the state or a combination of both. However, persecution advances to the extremes of ethnic cleansing or genocide not necessarily with the help of the state. The biggest fear about the Yunus government is that it is bound to fail once the popular Islamist forces in Bangladesh push forward against it. Minority areas where the writ of the state is even suspended for a short duration can become dangerous sites of bloodshed. Without a party or a mandate, the Yunus government doesn't have the wherewithal to think courageously or act decisively. As in Winston Churchill’s words – albeit in a different context – its fate is to be “decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent.” This is the danger in Bangladesh, as in most other Islamic societies. We may think of Egypt and Syria as other typical examples. On one side, there is grassroots radicalisation which demands from the other side a decisive and repressive state apparatus to contain it. The minorities, among whom the most vocal are the Hindus, are somewhat aware of these developments, even if they are not conscious of all the details. They have sensed that something dangerous is unfolding. The subtext of their political engagements becomes clear when read against this background. The Hindus have largely organised themselves along an obvious path. They are voicing their demands in the language of minority rights. In practical terms, if an exodus of minorities were to happen, either legally or illegally, they would first have to liquidate their property on a massive scale so that it can be transferred across borders. Democratic institutions in favour of minorities would at the very least buy them time to plan such an exit or safeguard their lives through whichever available means. Within this broader minority anxiety, there has been a growing radicalisation of Hindus. A threat to the community is one of the best excuses to recruit its members to radical causes. While the Bangladesh police and judicial apparatus seem keen to blame ISKCON for this, the truth might be more subtle. One clue lies in the slogan of the radicals – “Jai Sri Ram”, not “Jai Sri Krishna”. This sounds like a gesture of appeal and solidarity towards the Hindutva movement in India rather than an autonomous radicalisation of Krishna worshippers. There is no benefit to be gained from this strain of minority politics. At worst, such an impractical show of radicalism would accelerate the persecution of Hindus as a whole. The natural interest of minorities in delaying or doing away with ethnic cleansing is paradoxically mirrored by a similar interest on the part of nearly every organised Islamist group in Bangladesh. These groups, which include the radicalised on-ground activists of nominally secular parties like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), would not want to proceed with their plans just yet. Islamists draw lessons from each other’s projects, as well as ethnic cleansing efforts by other movements. Just like the secular world, the Islamist world too would have observed the success of the Taliban and the failure of Myanmar. Taliban was a case study for the insurgency in Syria, and it surely would have been one for Islamists in Bangladesh too. Every ethnic cleanser wants a clean ethnic cleansing. The limited success of the Myanmar army-supported efforts to clear out Rohingyas, and the later civil war would serve equally as negative examples for Bangla Islamists. Bangladesh borders Myanmar and hosts over a million Rohingya refugees in camps, with no repatriation or rehabilitation in sight. The Islamists are thus faced with a marshmallow test, which rewards delayed gratification. Only the assurance of non-intervention from the native army – if not its total collaboration – can make a total ethnic cleansing possible. Being the biggest state in the South Asia region, the Indian ‘sphere of influence’ is something that both the Bangladesh government and the opposition parties within have to reckon with. The ‘anti-India sentiment’ in Bangladesh, much talked about in Indian media these days, draws from two distinct sources – one is the need for the new social order to distance itself from Sheikh Hasina’s legacy, and the other is the desire for unobstructed persecution of minorities. The position of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is, however, paradoxical here. On the one hand, the party has dug a hole for itself by positioning itself against immigration, having incorporated a closed-border policy into its ideological project; also, the party might believe that readiness to accept refugees makes an exodus actually happen. The BJP’s situation is complicated further by Indian opposition figures like Mamata Banerjee and Uddhav Thackeray, questioning the Central government regarding the ineffectiveness of its approach towards Bangladesh. Banerjee might have even broken an invisible boundary by broaching the demand for a UN peacekeeping force in Bangladesh. UN peacekeepers are not extremely effective – the subtext, once again, is that intervention is being considered a real possibility in Bangladesh if and when the situation deteriorates. Another deeply troubling alternative can be gleaned from the histories of genocide: the lack of conditions for expulsions may create the conditions for destruction. If the Indian government prevents Bangladeshi minorities from seeking asylum within its borders, it may fast-track the latter.

Sharad Pawar: Victim of BJP's,"What ails regional leaders like Sharad Pawar or Lalu Prasad Yadav is not just their ill health. As companies that fail to quickly adapt to new technologies lag behind, the regional politicians who fail to grasp innovations in politics are bound to stagnate. Sharad Pawar admitted that he went for talks with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form a government in Maharashtra in 2019. No one would have been surprised with the revelation – Pawar’s “mixed signals” are anyway a stuff of legend. But five years after that fruitless discussion, Sharad Pawar is the leader of a depleted party, losing a large chunk of his votes and party to his nephew Ajit Pawar, with seemingly no way back into electoral politics. Pawar is not alone in his troubles. One may look at the Hooda family and many other one-caste leaders such as Mayawati who have been struggling for over a decade. Their undoing, it must be said, is not entirely due to their own faults. A historical change in the way in which politics is conducted in the country underpins their slow decline. We may call this process the ‘sub-casteisation of politics.' Even though the BJP is seen as a party against caste politics, it has brought something new to caste politics. Its decisions forced it to think beyond the electoral reliance on dominant castes in Indian states. We have ample evidence to believe that the BJP is not just focused on winning elections, they want to win elections on its terms, i.e. without an over-reliance on the power of dominant castes. Into the stagnating mire of caste politics, the BJP brought two innovations. First, it displaced the dominant castes by assembling accumulated resentment against their political domination. Thus, the BJP’s new caste politics has consciously tried to undermine the political power of Jats in Haryana, Patidars in Gujarat, Yadavs in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Marathas in Maharashtra and so on. Second, it assembled the politically marginalised sub-castes as an electoral tour de force. Hindutva as an ideology helps the BJP to prevent the total consolidation of a dominant caste for itself as well as to provide a glue to stick various sub-castes together. Neither Hindutva nor caste politics alone can consistently win elections. However, the synthesis of both presents a lethal combination. Narendra Modi’s, along with Amith Shah's, true contribution to the Hindutva movement is this synthesis of Hindutva with subcaste politics. The upper castes tend to be ideologically bound to the BJP; thus they vote for the BJP irrespective of what’s on offer. Since the BJP has this upper caste vote bank assured, it is at ease with wooing subcastes. Hindutva reductionism, or the inability to see BJP as something more than Hindutva, often blinds opponents to these tactics and thus prevents them from countering it. The Bagdis and Matuas in Bengal and the Vanjara in Maharashtra, among many others, were brought to the electoral mainstream by the BJP. This sub-casteisation of politics works by building a ‘coalition of coalitions’—a coalition of small castes at the local level, and a coalition of these coalitions at the state level. Within this broader framework of change, the story of Sharad Pawar has its own unique trajectory. Pawar is hardly the passive victim of the BJP’s machinations, but rather an architect of his own downfall, albeit in an indirect way. Sharad Pawar was shaped as a leader of the Maratha peasantry—but he also imbibed two other traditions which propelled him into national significance. First, he played the role of a benevolent patriarch, much loved in Marathi politics which produces one patriarch after the other. Second, he was deeply shaped by the non-Brahmin movement in Maharashtra; in an interview with Jabbar Patel, he admitted to being influenced by the egalitarian legacy of the Bhakti movement, whose spirit he wanted to carry forward in a secular form. He has frequently been accused of being an atheist. Whether true or not, that he faced such an accusation and was forced to deny it in public speaks about the modernist position he occupied in Marathi society. These two traditions and Pawar’s role within them need some unpacking. It is a truism to say that Marathi society is patriarchal. This would be true of nearly every social group in the subcontinent, including the diverse matrilineal groups. But patriarchy is expressed quite literally in Marathi politics—from Yashwantrao Chavan onwards, the presence of commanding male figures in Marathi politics is no coincidence. Pawar was the most benevolent among such patriarchs by most standards. First and foremost, he served the political and economic interests of the feudal Maratha lords, the stereotypical owners of the farmlands and sugarcane factories. Hardly any discontent is registered against him, and much of the corruption allegations he faced as the agriculture minister in the UPA government came through his defence of their interests. But, beyond this patronage of his core support base, Pawar is the only Marathi patriarch who successfully balanced constitutional values with his reign. He always had good relations with Muslims, and even with Dalits to some extent. During his tenure as chief minister, Maharashtra did witness terrible caste atrocities—but Pawar was always considered approachable by the wave of leaders who gave fresh energy to the Dalit movement in the state. Ramdas Athawale, for instance, continues to have a sense of comradeship with Sharad Pawar, in spite of switching camps. He was a full-time politician in a true sense, engaging in solving everyday conflicts as much as intervening to stop communal riots in the aftermath of the demolition of Babri Masjid. Pawar remains one of the few faces who has given a victorious look to the non-Brahmin social reformist forces and movements of Maharashtra, even though the politics in the state has been dominated by non-Brahmins. Moreover, his feminist interventions are understated—he played a role in opening the armed forces to women, legislating reservations for women in panchayat elections and also in winning them property rights. Fitting with this quality that is unusual for patriarchs, he shaped his daughter Supriya Sule into a popular leader within his party. Pawar is something of a universalist in these senses, an ardent social democrat who is not a factionalist unlike Bal or Uddhav Thackeray who secure only the interests of Mumbai. Naturally, he thrived in a post-imperial society like Maharashtra, which prides itself in its quasi-collectivist ethos and tries to securely bind itself under one figure. The projection of unity so characteristic of Marathi society was represented perfectly on the political scene by Sharad Pawar. The very criticism against Pawar was not that his principles were wrong, but that he did not live up to them all the time. This combination is what propelled him to Delhi, where he was a mainstay for years. As a Congress politician, he came close to the highest executive post in the country and in the party but was left out, each time in favour of a different rival. Finally, he snapped against Sonia Gandhi after she became Congress president and broke away from the party to form the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). He and his supporters pushed it as a moment of Marathi asmita on the part of the slighted leader. Nonetheless, he was a major part of successive UPA governments, but only after a brief courtship with the BJP—he must have thought 2014 would arrive a decade earlier. In Tamil Nadu, Karunanidhi had made a similar mistake. Seeing that Hindutva was not becoming dominant just yet, Pawar and the NCP returned to the secular camp, as did the DMK. Once he left the grand old party, Pawar became more and more a representative of his limited social base primarily revolving around the Maratha agrarian economy, slowly losing the universalism which characterised his peak. The Congress typically produced its best results when it combined the landed caste leadership at the regional level with the strong nationalist and unifying impulse at the central level. Without this central impulse, the leaders who quit the party quickly descend into a structurally feudal way of functioning. The result of Pawar’s newfound confinement was that the NCP remained limited to western Maharashtra. This restriction to one region is, incidentally, one of the biggest weaknesses of non-BJP parties in Maharashtra. Even though they speak for Marathis as a whole, none of them are a pan-Maharashtrian party in any meaningful sense. Pawar thus sacrificed presence on the ground in favour of a particular ideological positioning, and it benefitted him for some years. The rise of the BJP under Modi, when it finally came a decade after Pawar parted ways with them, kickstarted the new milieu in caste politics to which Pawar never really adjusted. Rich third-world farmers need state power to get subsidies, Minimum Support Prices, disaster compensation, the right prices in the global market and at every step of the way as they try to be competitive in the global market. Without the right connections at the Centre or at least the state, such parties would collapse as they would not serve any of the interests of their social base. This dependence on state power is what makes such classes take on a comprador nature. The very source of Pawar’s strength—that he was from a non-Brahmin agrarian, dominant caste in a feudal society—thus turned into his weakness in two different but connected ways. The BJP was determined to end the political dominance of Marathas in Maharashtra, and chose Devendra Fadnavis, from the slighted Brahmin caste, as the right antidote. This decision was as much driven by the push from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), whose Nagpur bastion is famously Brahminical, as much as it is by the need to blunt the achievements of Maratha dominance. In the final instance, however, the choice of a Brahmin leader is more incidental than a planned push of Brahminism—it so happens that the Brahmin caste was left out of direct power by the non-Brahmin politicians and are well placed to lead a reconciliation of castes under Hindutva. The first-past-the-post system is also more conducive for numerically small groups to play an outsized role in politics. Through Hindutva-ised subcaste politics, the BJP could both recognise the aspirations of small castes and their latent political potency. This double recognition is what makes the BJP win unprecedented victories even when the wind is against them. The opposition parties that proudly articulate issue-based politics often fail to think beyond their traditional vote banks that do not include small castes. Sharad Pawar was a victim of this determined Hindutva project of constructing Hindu unity. As the BJP spread across Maharashtra, they weaned away smaller OBCs from the necessity of voting Congress, NCP, Shiv Sena or any other party. This reduced the electoral power of the Maratha agrarian economy, by giving political representation to many of its dependents. Once the BJP became the biggest party, the class factor also kicked in. Invested agriculturists, entrepreneurs and their regional leaders could not afford to be at odds with the ruling party, and they soon buckled to the BJP via Ajit Pawar. In any case, a Maratha being forever a chief minister was not possible. The Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) now has to reckon, even if belatedly, with the changed equations in caste politics. Supriya Sule, or another leader, would have to take up the mantle for this change in direction. Old leaders find it difficult to reinvent themselves, not just because of their physical limitations, but also the sedimented debts, relations, and emotions which reduce their flexibility. So, Sharad Pawar himself is unlikely to reinvent himself—but Maharashtra, let alone India, is even less likely to roll back the years to a time when a dominant caste leader could stitch together a winning electoral coalition on the basis of caste arithmetic.

Jharkhand Lynching,"""Even in a crowd of hundred, you could tell he was a Muslim."" This is how Arshad Ansari described his uncle Sheikh Tajuddin who was brutally thrashed while on his usual morning run to work to another village. Tajuddin (50) a resident of Ghous Nagar, Kapali, Jamshedpur offered his Fajr (early morning) prayer and went on with his day. He left home around 8-9 am on 8 December towards Sapra village to buy a goat. This is where he faced the wrath of four young local men. His son, Tabrez Alam recounted in the FIR: The FIR was filed at the time when he was still admitted in the TMH (Tata Main Hospital). Four men — Mannu Yadav, Chela Yadav, Sanjay Yadav and Gautam Mandal — have now been arrested and jailed, the local corroborated to The Quint. Sheikh Alauddin, Tajuddin's uncle stated that he used to go in the morning to buy vegetables, goats or chickens. ""That is how he ran his livelihood. He didn't exclusively only buy goats, but whatever was available to sustain the family,"" he noted. Meanwhile in the FIR, the main charges of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) that have been applied are 109 (attempt to murder), 126 (2) punishment for wrongful restraint and 117 (2) punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt among others. Tajuddin is survived by a wife, a son and three daughters who are married. He lived approximately 6-7 kilometers away from the spot he was beaten up. Although Tajuddin was rushed to RIMS (Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences) but on 13 December around 6:30 pm he succumbed to his injuries. His nephew, Arshad Ansari noted that in the past 2-4 months, he visited the village a few times for the things he had to buy as he was familiar with the sellers there, it was a mutually decided trade. The locals told Ansari that, ""Had it happened in their village, they would have never let the men do what they did to him."" The family stated that Tajuddin had a simple demeanor who never picked up a fight with anyone and was not confrontational as a person. The direct consequence of his death is also a burden being carried by his son, Tabrez as their family has lost their breadwinner. ""The police told us that some men locally made a fuss that he was stealing the goat and this is ridiculous. If any one us is carrying a chicken, goat or vegetable we have bought, is it safe to assume we're stealing?,"" asked Ansari. Meanwhile, The Quint also spoke to Rajiv Singh, SHO, Adityapur who said that when the police reached on the spot and found Tajuddin lying on the ground after being beaten up. The police then picked him up and admitted it to the hospital. But, he rubbished the family's allegations that he was possibly killed due to his Muslim identity. Singh stated that he was beaten due to theft suspicion. ""We are still investigating into it and are trying to help the family as much as we can. Tajuddin had earlier got some surgery done because of which had weakness too. There were a lot of internal injuries that Tajuddin got and hence he died.""

The Methodology,"1. SELECTING A STORY FOR FACT CHECK We stand on neutral ground while picking up a story to fact-check devoid of any political or circumstantial bias. Sifting through requests from our audiences is the first step towards selecting a claim to begin the fact-checking process. We track mainstream and social media non-stop for possibly dubious information, propaganda, suspiciously viral posts and misinformation, including contentious/controversial quotes attributed to public figures. Such claims can reach us by way of tweets or controversial speeches by politicians, hashtags designed to provoke, viral videos, memes, Facebook pages and messaging apps like WhatsApp. The virality of topics is a stand-out criterion for a fact check. We make extensive use of internet tools like Meta Content Library and Google Trends to keep a tab on what is being shared widely at any point. Conspicuous rumours and debates in the public domain on issues designed to trigger controversy or social conflict could also trigger the fact-checking process. 2. RESEARCH AND INVESTIGATION Once material for a fact check is decided upon, it is discussed during an editorial meeting. The next step is to establish an understanding of the material, and exactly what was said or posted. Extreme caution is exercised to arrive first at whether the claim is even fact-checkable. We do not pick up opinions for fact check or try to debunk claims made in the form of opinion. After establishing what precisely the claim is, we reach out directly to the person or the entity and seek evidence to support the claim. We first seek the claimant's reaction by all possible means. Our focus is then on the credibility and reliability of the source. We rely on government websites, reputed journals, websites of well known organizations, magazines, dailies or company publications for source material of claims and data. Apart from conventional methods of reaching out to possible sources, we also use various internet tools to verify the origin of viral photographs or videos before arriving at a conclusion. Contacting experts on the subject, official authorities or police and recording their views is also an important element that runs alongside in the fact check process. 3. CROSS VERIFICATION FROM THE SPOT TV Today Network has one of the largest national reporting resources in the country. As and when required, we use this wide network of reporters and stringers spread across the country and abroad to cross-check facts on the ground. To ensure authenticity and impartiality, we never assign the responsibility of a cross-verification or corroboration to a reporter who may have filed his/her own report on the same subject or who has been a primary source for an information we are looking into. We provide hyperlinks where possible within our stories pointing to the source of information and evidence used to reach a conclusion so that readers can themselves track authenticity. 4. REPORT WRITING AND REVIEW We try to present verified facts in a simple, precise and transparent manner along with a deep, relevant perspective. We put together reports with an adequate level of detail, but easy to consume and understand, with a clear path tracking how we reached the conclusions we did. A great deal of attention is paid to the tone and tenor of the subject matter in fact check posts in order to underscore neutrality. We refrain from editorial comment and restrict ourselves to the specific fact we have checked. The report then goes through another review by a copy editor before publication. 5. PUBLISHING AND FEEDBACK After publication of a fact checked report, we closely monitor feedback from our audiences through story comments or social media. If an error is brought to our notice, we examine it thoroughly and, if necessary, effect an update or correction in accordance with our well-established correction policy.",fake,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check,https://www.indiatoday.in/methodology
Our Correction Policy,"India Today Fact Check corrects errors as quickly as possible and with high levels of transparency.

Muslim man kills Hindu live-in partner? Delhi case falsely given communal angle,"This incident from Delhi has no communal angle. Virendra Singh killed his live‑in partner, Radha, after they had a heated argument over drinking. A Muslim man allegedly killed his Hindu live-in partner, stuffed her body in his car, and was on his way to dispose of it when the police caught him at a checkpoint. This allegation has been widely shared online alongside a Hindi TV9 Bharatvarsh headline that reads: “In Delhi, man murders live-in partner, stores her body in a car and goes to sleep.” The headline was shared with captions like, “My Abdul is different... Abdul has committed another crime. He killed his loving partner, a Hindu girl, in Delhi and was taking her body into his car to dispose of it... On the way, his car was caught during police checking, and it was found that he had killed the Hindu woman living with him."" The name Abdul is often used as a euphemism for Muslims on social media. India Today Fact Check found that this incident took place on November 26 in Delhi. The person accused of murdering his live-in partner, however, is a Hindu man called Virendra Singh.OUR PROBE We searched TV9 Bharatvarsh’s social media accounts and found the same graphic in a November 27 Facebook post, which also contained a link to a news report. Curiously, the report’s details did not match the viral claim. According to TV9 Bharatvarsh, 35-year-old Virendra Singh strangled his live-in girlfriend to death following a dispute over drinking alcohol. He left her body in his car and went to sleep drunk. In the morning, a neighbour's complaint led to the police recovering the body and arresting Singh. No communal angle was mentioned in the report. Subsequently, we found more news reports about the incident. According to The Times of India, the victim was a 44-year-old woman named Radha. She was murdered by her live-in partner, Virendra Singh, who was already married and had kids. Reportedly, Singh was heavily intoxicated when he killed Radha. He carried her body to his car with the help of two other associates. Per the report, he intended to dispose of the body later but fell asleep before he could do so. A police officer told the Indian Express, “The house they were living in is in Virender’s name. He had convinced the woman to sell her own house in Palam and bought the three-storey house, which they were currently living in, with the money made from the sale. Cash worth Rs 21 lakh was found in the house.” According to a police statement, on the morning of November 26, the Chhawla police station received a PCR call. When the police reached the spot at Najafgarh’s Deenpur Extension, they found a Swift car locked and parked with a woman’s dead body on the rear seat. Upon interrogation, Virendra Singh admitted his guilt and said that when the victim asked him not to drink, they got into a quarrel. During this, he strangulated her and put her body in his car. Speaking to India Today Fact Check, DCP Dwarka, Ankit Kumar Singh, confirmed there was no communal angle to the case, and both the victim and the killer were Hindu. Thus, it’s clear that the viral claim is false.

'Not doing anything wrong': Meet the man who's making your private data public,"On December 1, we published a report about a website called ProxyEarth.org that allows you to fetch the personal data (address, ID proof, alternate numbers, etc.) of Indians using only phone numbers. While the website had not been blocked in India at the time of writing this, in the aftermath of our report, it began running at a reduced capacity, often with glitches. Nevertheless, we decided to dig deeper. India Today Fact Check’s investigation led us to a man who identifies himself as Rakesh, one of the key persons behind ProxyEarth.org. While this might not be his real name, we will henceforth refer to him as such for convenience. Under the pretext of purchasing leaked data in bulk for marketing, we spoke to Rakesh at length. And among other things, Rakesh said he had done no wrong in creating this website.Who is ‘Rakesh’? Rakesh has a fairly wide but anonymous presence online. But we managed to connect his many accounts thanks to a common element: his profile photo, which is an anime-style portrait of a young man wearing a plaid shirt and featuring the Indian flag and the logos of CapCut and Adobe After Effects. We found Instagram, X, and YouTube accounts featuring the same photo. All of these accounts share more or less the same type of content: hacks for pirating premium video editing apps, sending bulk messages, temporary OTPs, live webcams, etc.We were still looking for a face when we found the Threads account connected to his Instagram. It had a different profile photo — not exactly a real face, but something close. It appears to be a heavily edited version of a real person’s face, with the same After Effects logo in the back. We aren’t sure if this is actually Rakesh.How we found himUpon examining the source code (backend) of the website, we found mention of a Telegram channel called “@uploadfileofficial”. On that channel, we found the link to another Telegram channel called “@rakeshxofficial”.On “@rakeshxofficial”, he identified himself as an editor and a programmer. Both channels had the same profile photos mentioned earlier.‘I did nothing wrong’While investigating the web of multiple social media accounts, websites, and Telegram channels, we found a phone number. We then called this number on the pretext of buying a package of leaked data.Rakesh believed us and asked for details about the kind of data we wanted. During this conversation, he said that he worked with a team of 10–12 people, who had together created the ProxyEarth.org website. He said that this was only one of their many projects.advertisementRakesh also claimed that he was from Bihar, from a town bordering Eastern Uttar Pradesh. This matched with his number’s TrueCaller information.Rakesh said that he was not doing anything wrong. He told us that he was not responsible for any of the data breaches — he was only using existing data leaks to power the website. He said that he had only merged multiple such databases for this website.We found that whenever you enter a mobile number on the website, it initiates an API call to connect with leaked databases at the backend. As we mentioned in our previous story, there have been reports of several major leaks related to Indians in the last couple of years.Why did he do this?For Rakesh, the opportunity to access people’s personal data was just a bait. He wanted people to explore his other ventures, which are his actual source of income.As mentioned above, Rakesh advertises hacks for pirating premium video editing apps, live webcams, and other services on his social media. He told India Today Fact Check, “I am using this website as a platform to attract traffic and to advertise my other products.”advertisementWhen we pointed out that the Department of Telecom may soon block his website, Rakesh said calmly that creating a replica with a different domain name would not be difficult at all.- EndsPublished By: Pathikrit SanyalPublished On: Dec 2, 2025 We found Instagram, X, and YouTube accounts featuring the same photo.

Privacy nightmare: Your personal data is now out in the open — just a click away,"A massive Indian data leak appears to have become publicly available. A website called ProxyEarth.org now lets you search for anyone’s personal information by just entering their phone number! The website has a sleek, easy-to-use user interface. All you have to do is input an Indian mobile number. The website says it works only for numbers starting with 6, 7, 8, or 9. When you enter the mobile number, the site appears to run commands and then triangulate the location on a map. It even seems to show the network strength of the number at that location. The website also shows your name, address, father’s name, an alternate mobile number, the name of your cellular service, email address, and either an Aadhaar, voter ID, PAN, or a driving licence number. As many people are flagging it on social media tagging the government, it is possible that the site might be blocked.What you should worry about The other data, when available, is largely accurate, if not up to date. The data available on the website appears to be information provided at the time of buying a SIM card: name, father’s name, home address, alternate number, and ID proof. There may be a silver lining for some people here. The data appears outdated in many cases. In several instances, we found old addresses and even old network carriers (which may have been ported to new carriers since). This indicates that the data is most likely old and from when one parched the SIM card.What not to worry about The website does not track live locations. Nor does it show the number bars your device has. These features are there to add more credibility to it. The live location was wrong in every instance we checked, where we knew the person’s current location. The network strength gives the impression of live tracking. But the “good” or “bad” rating alongside it likely indicates how much data is part of the leak. This means a “good” rating is bad news. And vice versa. One can also see a “Live” logo in the upper right corner of the screen. This is also an embellishment to add to the website’s credibility for “live tracking” and is misleading.What is ProxyEarth.org? According to WhoIs, a tool that tells you details about any site’s registration, the website was created on October 17 this year.Recent data breaches As of now, it appears that this might not be a new data breach. Rather, someone has likely compiled data from older breaches — already available for sale on the dark web — in an easy-to-use interface. In January 2024, personal data, including the names of mobile users, their phone numbers, residential addresses, Aadhaar details, and names of family members of nearly 75 crore Indians, were reported to be put up for sale online. And in 2023, an American cybersecurity company said that personally identifiable information of 81.5 crore Indian citizens, including Aadhaar numbers and passport details, was being sold on the dark web for $80,000. To check if your personal data has been part of an existing leak, search for your email address on haveibeenpwned.com. It is advisable not to run ProxyEarth.org on your mobile device, as we do not know who is behind this website and what their motives are.- EndsPublished By: Pathikrit SanyalPublished On: Dec 1, 2025",fake,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/privacy-nightmare-your-personal-data-is-now-out-in-the-open-just-a-click-away-2829004-2025-12-01
"Fact Check: Did goons attack fish markets in Bengal? No, this video is from Delhi","The video is from the Gokulpuri area in New Delhi where a Hindu group threatened vendors for selling meat and fish close to a temple. A video is being widely shared online with claims that it shows a tense scene of a group of men threatening a local fish seller and other meat shop owners in West Bengal. In the video, one man starts vandalising a fish vendor's shop, threatening: “No meat should be visible around.” The video was shared with captions like: “Shocking: Reportedly, a group of goons entered a fish market in Bengal and vandalised several local fish shops. So now they want to stop Bengalis from eating fish too?” India Today Fact Check found that the incident happened in the Gokulpuri area of Delhi on November 27.OUR PROBE A reverse image search of the video’s keyframes led to a longer video on Instagram, which identified the location and date. The video was captioned: “Hindu nationalist supporters forcibly evicted meat sellers and shut down their shops, citing the presence of a nearby temple.” The location was listed as Delhi’s Gokulpuri, and the date was November 27. A closer look at the footage revealed ""Gokulpuri"" clearly visible on several walls, confirming the incident's location. In the comments of this video, we also observed that many had tagged the account of one Rahul Pachauri, the man allegedly behind these attacks. We checked his Instagram account (@hindu_52_07), and found the viral video shared on November 28 with the caption: “There was news coming from Gokulpuri area that meat trading was taking place within 30 metres of the temple by Hindu and Muslim traders despite previously being warned by the police. Hindu youths banded together and warned the meat traders that if they want to do this in future, do it at a distance from the temple. If someone is found doing business around the temple, legal action will be taken against them.” We found another video shared by the account the same day, captioned, “Meat trade was going on in Gokulpuri. Today, a warning has been given openly that meat trade will be removed from the temple soon. Otherwise, police action will be taken.” In the video, Pachauri asserted that they were enforcing a specific rule: that meat vendors must maintain a distance of at least 500 metres from any religious place. Failure to do so would result in police action. The man in the viral video threatening the fish vendor can be seen in this video, standing behind Pachauri. We found his Instagram account, which stated that his name is Aakash Pandat. We reached out to Rahul Pachauri to verify the details of the incident. He confirmed to India Today Fact Check that it took place on November 27, between 6 and 7 pm. He claimed he was falsely accused of specifically targeting Muslim-owned shops. According to him, he had no animosity towards Muslims. His concern, he said, was that meat shops should not operate near a temple. He added that he and his companions, who were detained by the police, have since been released. Notably, we also did not find any credible news reports of meat traders being harassed in West Bengal recently. Thus, it is clear that the viral video has been shared with misleading claims.

Fact Check: UP wedding ruckus viral as RSS attack on Catholic school in Telangana,"This video actually shows a crowd looting snacks and other food items at a mass wedding in Hamirpur, UP. A video of a large crowd creating a ruckus is making the rounds on social media. In it, people can be seen rushing hither and thither, hurling cartons. Those sharing the video claimed that it was from Telangana, where Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers attacked a Catholic school. Sharing the video on X, one person wrote, “After attacking Muslims, RSS extremists have now turned their violence towards Christians. At St. Mother Teresa Catholic School in Mancherial, Telangana, they attacked the principal, Fr. Raimon Joseph, and forcibly marked his forehead with a tilak. This is not Gandhi’s India.” India Today Fact Check found that the video actually shows a crowd looting snacks and other food items at a wedding in Uttar Pradesh’s Hamirpur.OUR PROBE Reverse searching keyframes from the viral video led us to the same clip shared by Jist News on Instagram on November 27. Its caption noted that at a mass wedding in Uttar Pradesh’s Hamirpur, chaos ensued when people rushed toward the snack counters after the ceremonies, leading to a stampede-like situation. Several people reportedly fell and were injured. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jist (@jist.news) We found several news reports about the incident. According to an Indian Express report, it was a government-sponsored mass wedding held on November 25 at the playground of Swami Brahmanand Vidyalaya in Rath town. Guests rushed to grab snacks and looted boxes of chips and other food items. Moreover, we found no credible news reports of any recent attack on a Catholic school in Telangana. However, in April 2024, a school in Telangana was attacked over a saffron clothing dispute. As per a report by the Indian Express, a missionary-run school in the Mancherial district was attacked by a group of villagers after students dressed in saffron religious clothing were reportedly informed that their parents needed prior approval for them to attend school without the standard uniform. As per reports, some men surrounded Principal Joseph, beat him up, and forcibly applied a tilak on his forehead.

"Fact Check: Did Lawrence Bishnoi just get bail? No, this is an old video","The video is from 2020 and shows Bishnoi being presented before the court in Fazilka. He is still lodged at Sabarmati Central Jail in Ahmedabad. A video going viral on social media allegedly shows gangster Lawrence Bishnoi being released on bail. The video shows the gangster being escorted by police officers. In the video, the location was identified as Fazilka, a district in Punjab where Bishnoi was born. A reporter in the video asks Bishnoi how he felt, to which he responds in Hindi, “It feels great. Hopefully, all other cases turn out like this one.” India Today Fact Check found that the video is from 2020. Bishnoi hasn’t been granted bail.OUR PROBE We did not find any credible news reports about Lawrence Bishnoi being granted bail. He is currently imprisoned in Sabarmati Central Jail in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. According to an Indian Express report, the Ministry of Home Affairs renewed its order in August this year to restrict his movement for another year. A reverse image search led us to a longer version of the video, uploaded to YouTube by RB Live Media on February 24, 2020. According to the information provided by RB Live Media, the video is from the same day when Bishnoi was produced in the Fazilka court in Punjab. This was in connection with an attempted murder case under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. He was acquitted on that charge. Recently, the Bishnoi gang returned to the headlines when, on November 19, Anmol Bishnoi, Lawrence’s younger brother, was brought back from the United States of America to India and handed over to the National Investigation Agency. Anmol is wanted in connection with the killing of Nationalist Congress Party leader Baba Siddique, a shooting at actor Salman Khan’s residence, and the murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, among other charges. He has been absconding since 2022. Therefore, we can conclude that the video being shared does not show Lawrence Bishnoi being granted bail.

Fact Check: This clip DOES NOT show student dying after 100 sit-ups as punishment,"This video does not show the Maharashtra student who died after a 100 sit-up punishment. It shows an eight-year-old who suffered a cardiac arrest and died on January 10 in Ahmedabad. No news reports about this incident mention corporal punishment as a cause. In Maharashtra’s Vasai, a 13-year-old schoolgirl reportedly died after being subjected to corporal punishment for being late. The class VI student was allegedly made to do 100 sit-ups as punishment for arriving late on November 8. The student, Anshika Gaud — though news reports have also used the name Kajal Gaud — was reportedly suffering from a pre-existing medical condition, experienced difficulty in breathing later that day, and was hospitalised. She died on November 14. A video now going viral shows a schoolgirl collapsing onto a bench in a school corridor. Those sharing the clip claimed that this eight-year-old collapsed and died after being punished with 100 sit-ups for arriving late to school. A Facebook user shared the video and wrote, “8 Years Old Died Due to Cardiac Arrest After 100 Sit-ups Punishment in School.” India Today Fact Check India Today Fact Check found that while this video does show an eight-year-old dying because of cardiac arrest, it has nothing to do with corporal punishment. Here’s what we found:OUR PROBE A reverse image search of keyframes from the viral clip led us to the same video shared by an X account on January 10.

Gargi, a third-grader, became unwell shortly after arriving and slumped on a bench in the school corridor. Teachers quickly rushed her to Asarwa Civil Hospital. Sharmistha Sinha, the principal of the school, stated, ""The girl had no prior health issues. Doctors informed us that Gargi had suffered a cardiac arrest. They attempted to revive her and placed her on a ventilator support, but unfortunately, she did not survive."" Atul Tiwari, the Ahmedabad correspondent for India Today, who covered the story, confirmed the information, stating, ""On the morning of January 10, Gargi Ranpara climbed the stairs to school and suffered a cardiac arrest. This incident is unrelated to the 100 sit-ups or any other punishment administered by the school teachers."" According to a January 11 Times of India report, hospital authorities informed the police after Gargi's death. The police thereafter launched an investigation and sent her body for postmortem examination to determine the exact cause of her death. Bodakdev police inspector Apurva Patel said a case of accidental death had been lodged. We did not find any news reports about what a medical examiner's post-mortem report found.

The video was shared with captions like: “Cash started flying on the road after a truck full of cash overturned on the highway of Uttar Pradesh. Seeing this, about 500 people gathered on the spot and looted the notes.” India Today Fact Check found out that neither is the video from UP, nor did such an incident occur recently.

However, we found no credible news reports about it from either Uttar Pradesh or the rest of India. When we had a closer look at the video, we found some telltale clues that indicate it’s an AI-generated video. One, the video has a smooth, glossy texture that’s typical of synthetic media. Two, the limbs and faces of people in the crowd appeared distorted in many instances. Third, an autorickshaw visible in the video was misshapen and also did not have a door on its side at all. These clues and many others hinted at the video being AI-generated. On reverse-searching keyframes from the video, we found it was shared by an Instagram account named Arshad Arsh Edits.

Fact Check: Viral video DOES NOT show illegals running away from WB amid SIR drive,"The viral video actually shows a Shyama Puja immersion procession from October 30 in West Bengal’s Foonkotla. As West Bengal undergoes the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls, social media has been flooded with alarming claims. A video going viral right now purports to show undocumented Bangladeshi immigrants fleeing India because of the SIR drive in West Bengal. Several people, who shared this video, shared the clip with captions like, “BREAKING | Movement at Indo–Bangladesh Border,” and “A rush of Bangladeshis is heading back after SIR orders were issued in West Bengal.” India Today Fact Check found that the viral video shows the Shyama Puja immersion in West Bengal’s Foonkotla.

Illegal immigrants rush to Sealdah station post SIR? Here are the facts,"The video is indeed from Sealdah Station, but it has nothing to do with SIR. It, in fact, predates the announcement of SIR in West Bengal. Since the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls commenced in West Bengal, illegal immigrants have reportedly begun leaving the state for Bangladesh. A video now going viral on social media purports to show a massive crowd of Rohingya passengers rushing at the Sealdah railway station in West Bengal. One X user shared the video and wrote: ""SIR comes to Bengal. Rohingyas run from Bengal. Sealdah railway station"". India Today Fact Check found that the video is indeed from Sealdah station, but it has nothing to do with SIR. Also, it predates the announcement of SIR in West Bengal. With the help of Google Lens, we found the same video in a Facebook post from October 15. It is to be noted that the Election Commission of India announced the second phase of the SIR in 12 states and Union Territories, including West Bengal, on October 27. So, the viral video cannot be linked to the ongoing SIR drive in the state. The Facebook user who uploaded the video on October 15, Tofick Khan, wrote in the caption that a ruckus erupted at Sealdah Station as two children fell during a heavy rush of passengers from two trains. Apart from this, we found that he had also shared a clarification video about the viral claim on November 5. As per Khan, he had come to Sealdah Station from Lalgola on October 15. When he arrived, he found that another train had been announced on the same line. Apart from this, we found that he had also shared a clarification video about the viral claim on November 5. As per Khan, he had come to Sealdah Station from Lalgola on October 15. When he arrived, he found that another train had been announced on the same line. The announcement caused panic among the passengers, who started rushing out quickly from the train. Because of this, some children fell on the platform. Khan recorded the whole incident and shared the video on social media. We compared the Lalgola–Sealdah passenger train’s scheduled arrival time at Sealdah station with the time displayed on the platform clock in the viral video. The clock shows 16.19, or 4.19 pm, at the moment when the video was being recorded. The Lalgola–Sealdah passenger train is scheduled to reach Sealdah at around 4 pm. However, it gets delayed sometimes. Also, a train leaves Sealdah for Lalgola at 4.10 pm. It is possible that the small time margin between the trains and routine delays could create panic among the passengers. This provides validity to Khan's version of events. Notably, since the announcement of the SIR drive in West Bengal, there has reportedly been a surge of undocumented immigrants leaving the state for Bangladesh. This video, however, does not show that. - EndsPublished By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Nov 22, 2025Tune InMust Watch",fake,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/illegal-immigrants-rush-to-sealdah-station-post-sir-announcement-bengal-here-are-the-facts-2824321-2025-11-22
Fact Check: Bangladesh road rage video FALSELY shared as attack on Yunus press sec,"The video does not show Muhammaed Yunus's deputy press secretary. It’s a road rage incident, likely from Dhaka. On November 17, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was sentenced to death in absentia by the International Crimes Tribunal. Hasina, who is currently exiled in India, was found guilty of crimes against humanity for allowing lethal force that prosecutors claim resulted in over 1,400 protester deaths. She has vehemently denied the accusations, labelling the trial as ""biased and politically motivated."" Amid all this, a video allegedly showing the deputy press secretary to Bangladesh’s Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus getting attacked in the middle of the road has gone viral. Responding to such posts, many commented on how law and order were rapidly collapsing in Dhaka following the death sentence. India Today Fact Check found, however, that the video has been online since as early as September 2025, and the person in the video is not Yunus’s deputy press secretary.OUR PROBE A reverse image search led us to a longer version of the footage uploaded by the news organisation News Now Bangla on October 15. We also found another clip of the incident shared on September 30. All of this proves that this video predates Sheikh Hasina’s death sentence. In the video, we noticed a Bangladeshi number plate on one of the cars, indicating that the video was indeed from the country. When we compared the face of the man in the car being attacked with bothdeputy press secretaries to Yunus in Bangladesh, Apurba Jahangir and Azad Majumdar. The comparison given below makes it clear that neither secretary is in the viral video. Further, had Jahangir been publicly attacked, it would have made the national news in Bangladesh. We found no credible news reports about any such incident. India Today Fact Check reached out to the assistant press secretary to Muhammad Yunus, Nayem Ali, who confirmed no such incident has occurred and that the man in the video was not affiliated to Yunus’s press office. A Dhaka-based news organisation named, The Dissent, also debunked this claim. It reported that the deputy press secretary was not assaulted and noted that this was just a road-rage incident from the Gulshan area of Dhaka.

"Fact Check: This video of poll panel chief Gyanesh Kumar, Amit Shah is AI-generated","This video is not real. It has been created with the help of Artificial Intelligence. After the Bihar Assembly elections, several opposition parties, including the Congress, have raised questions over the impartiality of the Election Commission. A video now going viral purports to show Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar bowing at the feet of Home Minister Amit Shah. One Facebook user wrote in Hindi alongside the viral video: “The Election Commission at the feet! Those who want to know why such results came in the Bihar elections can watch this video and understand the truth. In this video, the supreme sycophant, Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, is seen kissing the feet of his master. Earlier, this gentleman was also his personal secretary. Those who are supposed to protect democracy while holding constitutional posts in India are brutally murdering democracy.” India Today Fact Check found that this video was created with the help of AI tools — it’s not real. We observed several anomalies in the video. For example, when Gyanesh Kumar drapes the shawl over Amit Shah, the other end of the shawl automatically reaches down to Amit Shah’s hand on its own. Also, both of them hold each other’s hands for an unnaturally long time. When we reverse-searched the keyframes of the video, we found an identical photo on the website of Content Garden. In it, Gyanesh Kumar can be seen draping a shawl over Amit Shah’s shoulders. According to the information given there, this photo was from 2023 when Gyanesh Kumar was serving as Secretary in the Ministry of Cooperation. On November 8, 2023, a national symposium was held in New Delhi to promote organic products. In the programme organised by National Cooperative Organics Limited, Gyanesh Kumar honoured Home Minister Amit Shah. According to a PIB press release, Amit Shah was the chief guest at this event. We found the video of this programme on the YouTube channel of Krishi Jagran Business. At the beginning of the video, Gyanesh Kumar can be seen honouring Home Minister Shah by draping a shawl and presenting a bouquet. But he does not bow in front of the Home Minister in the manner shown in the viral video. Clearly, this portion of the video was created using AI. We also tested the video with an AI detection tool.

"Fact Check: Protest in Bihar against 'vote chori'? No, this video is from Gujarat","This video from November 15 from Gujarat’s Netrang town shows AAP MLA Chaitar Vasava leading a rally on the occasion of Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary. Following the landslide victory of the National Democratic Alliance in the Bihar Assembly elections, many shared a video of a large crowd marching on a road. Allegedly, the video showed people of Bihar protesting against vote theft. The caption of the video read, “Entire Bihar came on the road to stop vote chori.” India Today Fact Check found that the video is not from Bihar, but from Gujarat. It is unrelated to the just-concluded Bihar Assembly polls. Reverse-searching keyframes from the viral video led us to a similar video on Instagram, dated November 15. This video’s Gujarati-language caption translates to, “Chaitar Vasava is a different kind of fun.” Alongside the captions, hashtags like “Chaitar Vasava” and “Netrang” were also used. Chaitar Vasava is an Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Gujarat’s Dediapada constituency, and Netrang is a small town in Gujarat’s Bharuch district, adjoining the Dediapada seat. Subsequent searches led us to a couple of reports published in the Dainik Bhaskar English and the Navbharat Times, dated November 16. Per these reports, Chaitar Vasava led a massive rally in Netrang on November 15 on the occasion of Birsa Munda’s 150th birth anniversary. These reports noted that the rallies showcased Adivasi unity.

Notably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also held a rally in Dediapada on November 15 and paid tribute to Birsa Munda on his birth anniversary.

Fact Check: Is Pak Army mobilising troops after Delhi terror attack? Viral video is OLD,"While it’s likely from Pakistan, this video has been online since as early as April, and is therefore not related to the terror attack in Delhi. The Centre assured Indians on November 12 that the perpetrators and sponsors of the terror attack near the Red Fort would be brought to justice swiftly. According to news reports, Pakistan-based outfits Jaish-e-Mohammad and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind may be linked to the terror module that was nabbed in Faridabad the morning of the attack. Now, a five-second-long video of a train carrying military tanks is being widely shared online. Allegedly, it shows the Pakistan army mobilising its troops from Balochistan to the Indian border, fearing retaliation from India. Sharing the video on X, one user wrote, “Fearing Indian retaliation after the Delhi Blast, Pakistan Army is moving troops, Arms and ammunition from Balochistan to the Indian border. With PoK, Balochistan will also get freedom.” India Today Fact Check, however, found that the video clip has been online since as early as April, and is therefore not related to the terror attack in Delhi.OUR PROBE Reverse-searching a screenshot from the video led us to the same clip shared on TikTok. We checked the date of upload, which said April 26 this year. This proves that the video far precedes the November 10 terror attack in Delhi. We then reviewed the profile “mrbeast66” that shared the video on TikTok. On the account, we found several posts geotagged to United King, Karachi, a bakery shop in Karachi’s Badar Commercial Street. Additionally, the video of the train shared by “mrbeast66” includes hashtags like “pak fooj zindabad” and “pakistan zindabad”. Based on these details, it’s likely that this video is from Pakistan. That being said, we were unable to determine the exact location of the video, or where the train’s destination was. Notably, however, April 25 was right in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack. India would go on to retaliate against Pakistan with Operation Sindoor in May. Thus, it is evident that while the video of the train carrying military tanks is likely from Pakistan, it predates the Delhi terror attack by several months — making the two things unrelated.

From Jamia to jail: Chancellor of terror-tainted Al-Falah has a shady past,"""Al-Falah"" is Arabic for success, prosperity, and well-being. It was an apt name for a medical college in Faridabad. And then the November 10 Delhi blast happened. The Al-Falah School of Medical Sciences welcomed its debut batch of aspiring doctors just six years ago in 2019. Since then, it has turned into a sprawling campus, buzzing with students, teachers, and other staff. The founder of Al-Falah University (of which the medical college is a part) is Jawad Ahmad Siddiqui. A former lecturer, Siddiqui is now the director and founder of approximately a dozen ventures under the Al-Falah Group of Companies umbrella. Needless to say, he did well for himself. And the thousands of students studying at his university, especially the would-be doctors, thought they would too. But the explosion outside the Red Fort in New Delhi, which killed at least 12 people and injured many more, has not only thrust the Al-Falah Group into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, but it has also tainted the reputation of the university beyond repair. And by extension, anyone involved with it. Jawad Ahmad Siddiqui. Had his university not been in the news for being the hub of the terrorists who allegedly executed the Delhi blast — and who were planning something much more sinister — chancellor and founder Jawad Ahmad Siddiqui would have been planning his birthday party at his plush mansion, called Al-Falah House, in Jamia Nagar. Sixty-one-year-old Jawad was born on November 15, 1964, as one of three sons to Hammad Ahmad Siddiqui. He grew up in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, the birthplace of Bhimrao Ambedkar, after whom the town has now been renamed. According to his (non-active) LinkedIn profile, Jawad Ahmad Siddiqui completed BTech in Industrial and Product Design from Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya in Indore. Later, his family moved to Delhi.Big dreams and shortcuts According to a former colleague who spoke to India Today Fact Check on the condition of anonymity, Jawad became a Mechanical Engineering lecturer at Jamia Millia Islamia in 1993. But his ambitions far exceeded the humble podium of a college. While working at Jamia, he dabbled in business and formed a few small companies with his brother Saood. Among these was Al-Falah Investments, which would eventually send them both to Tihar Jail for three years! Jamia to jail While at Jamia, Jawad persuaded some of his colleagues to invest in his business venture, promising hefty returns. However, he quickly became embroiled in a flurry of fraud, embezzlement, and cheating allegations. In 2000, a man called KR Singh lodged an FIR (No.43/2000) in Delhi’s New Friends Colony against Al Falah Investments Ltd. The case was investigated by the Economic Offence Wing of the Crime Branch in Delhi. Jawad was arrested and subsequently languished in jail for over three years with his brother. Rejecting his bail application in March 2003, the Delhi High Court noted that, in line with the allegations, the Forensic Science Laboratory in Delhi found that the “signatures of the investors were forged. The deposits were also received in the name of some of the companies which were non-existent. The petitioners diverted large funds received from the investors into their personal accounts and then misappropriated the same”. Jawad ultimately made bail in February 2004 and was later acquitted in the case by the Patiala Court in 2005, but only after he and his brother agreed to refund the investors they had defrauded.Faridabad college becomes ‘mini-Kashmir’ According to reliable sources, who did not want to be quoted, the Al-Falah School of Medical Sciences had a decent start back in 2019. But gradually, the college began hiring many doctors from Kashmir, primarily because they were cheap. Already a minority university, the environment on the campus became more and more orthodox following this. The management was apprised of the situation. It chose to ignore it. According to the same source, Dr Shaheen Saeed, who was arrested the day after the Delhi blast and has been linked to a terror module, was often seen persuading her colleagues and students into becoming more devout Muslims and wearing more conservative clothes like hijabs and burqas. In fact, she was even cautioned against such activities.More trouble at Al-Falah During the Covid-19 pandemic, nurses at Al-Falah alleged that they were fired when they demanded life insurance for working in a high-risk environment. Last year, medical interns were suspended when they protested the college’s poor infrastructure and the non-payment of stipends. Jawad may have been able to weather these storms.

"Trump order prompts removal of report on missing and murdered Indigenous people from federal websites Written by: Laerke Christensen Dec. 4, 2025 DOJ said it removed the ""Not One More"" report from its website to comply with a Trump administra ... Read More","About this rating The Department of Justice removed the report from its website but didn't outright call it ""DEI content."" Rather, a spokesperson told Snopes in an emailed statement the department removed the report following a Trump administration executive order on gender ideology, a concept that can fall under the wider diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) umbrella in policy discussions. In November 2025, a claim (archived) circulated online that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump removed a report on missing and murdered Native Americans, calling it ""DEI content."" One Facebook post on the topic read, ""The Trump Administration has Removed the Report on Missing and Murdered Native Americans, Calling It DEI Content!"" The claim also circulated on Instagram (archived), Threads (archived), Bluesky (archived) and Reddit (archived). Snopes readers wrote in to find out if the claim was true. The claim appeared to come from reporting by Oklahoma Watch, a nonprofit reporting project with a focus on public policy journalism. That outlet published an article on Nov. 14, 2025, titled, ""Trump Administration Removes Report on Missing and Murdered Native Americans, Calling It DEI Content."" According to that article, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Interior (DOI) had removed a report, titled, ""Not One More,"" that provided recommendations to the U.S. government on how to address a crisis of violence against Indigenous people who were ""at a disproportionate risk of experiencing violence, murder, or going missing,"" according to the DOJ website. The report covered both men and women and used the abbreviation MMIP for ""missing and murdered Indigenous people."" A DOJ spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Snopes that the department removed the report ""to ensure compliance with OPM [Office of Personnel Management] guidance regarding President Trump's Executive Order Defending Women."" The statement said the report remained available on external websites. The DOJ did not outright call the report ""DEI content"" in its statement. The executive order in question that reportedly led to the report's removal discussed biological sex and gender ideology, which are concepts that can fall under the wider diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) umbrella in policy discussions. Given the above, we have rated this claim as true. The report could not be accessed through the DOJ or DOI websites at the time of this writing. According to a DOI spokesperson, the department had linked to the report on its site but the link died when the DOJ removed the report from its website. We reached out to senators and representatives who campaigned to return the report to the DOJ and DOI websites to ask what they knew about the removal or whether the report might be restored. We await replies to our queries. According to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, a service that archives URLs, the ""Not One More"" report was last live at the link from the DOI website on Jan. 22, 2025. The Wayback Machine archived the link again on Feb. 2, 2025, where it led to a DOJ ""Page not found"" screen, meaning the DOJ removed the report sometime between Jan. 22 and Feb. 2, 2025. A spokesperson for the office of Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, who introduced the Not Invisible Act in the Senate in 2019 that formed the commission that published the ""Not One More"" report, said in an emailed statement that the office first discovered the report was missing on Feb. 8, 2025. Cortez Masto's office confirmed she and and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican senator from Alaska who chairs the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, wrote to the Trump administration to ask about restoring the ""Not One More"" report. The DOJ told Cortez Masto and Murkowski that the report ""was removed in compliance with President Trump's Executive Order 'Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,'"" according to Cortez Masto's office, which echoed the DOJ statement that Snopes received. In July 2025, around five months after the ""Not One More"" report disappeared from the DOJ's website, a group of Democratic representatives led by U.S. Reps. Sharice Davids, D-KY, and Gwen Moore, D-WI, also wrote to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who heads the DOJ, to call for the department to restore the ""Not One More"" report on its website. Samara Sheff, Moore's press secretary, confirmed via email that the representatives did receive a response from the DOJ, but that Moore ""is still focused on restoring the report"" to the DOJ website. According to the reply that Sheff shared with Snopes, Theodore Schroeder, then-deputy assistant attorney general, wrote that the department removed the report in line with the Trump administration's executive order on gender ideology. Schroeder added that the department was ""committed to addressing the issue of missing or murdered Indigenous people (MMIP)"" and that the removal of the report ""should not be misconstrued to indicate a change in this position or in our response to the recommendations issued by the Not Invisible Act Commission."" Schroeder did not say in the response whether the DOJ would restore the report link. The DOJ did not reply to follow-up questions from Snopes about why it found the ""Not One More"" report was not in compliance with the Trump administration's executive order on gender ideology. In their July 2025 letter, Democratic representatives led by Davids and Moore argued that ""the work done by the Not Invisible Act Commission explicitly does not promote gender ideology or extremism."" The representatives wrote, ""Though there is mention within the findings themselves that women compose a large percentage of MMIP individuals, there ceases to be a link between gender extremism and ideology and the work of the Not Invisible Commission."" ""Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"" was a sweeping executive order that laid out a new U.S. policy ""to recognize two sexes, male and female."" Part of this policy read: (e) Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. Agency forms that require an individual's sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity. Agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology. This subsection was the only part of the order that referred to government agencies removing content. It remained unclear at the time of this writing why the DOJ concluded the ""Not One More"" report promoted or otherwise inculcated gender ideology. The department had not restored the report to its website at the time of this writing, nor did it appear it intended to.

"Did Kristi Noem genuinely thank Trump for keeping hurricanes away? Written by: Jordan Liles Dec. 3, 2025 The homeland security secretary made the remark during a White House Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2, ... Read More","About this rating During a publicly broadcast Cabinet meeting Dec. 2, 2025, Noem truly said, ""Sir, you made it through hurricane season without a hurricane. And so, FEMA, FEMA … you, even you kept the hurricanes away, so we appreciate that."" However, audible laughter as well as Noem then continuing her FEMA comment showed the room received the ""you kept the hurricanes away"" remark as nothing more than an off-the-cuff joke. A rumor that circulated online in early December 2025 claimed U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem thanked President Donald Trump for keeping hurricanes away from the country through the 2025 hurricane season, following a remark Noem made during a publicly broadcast White House Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. For example, on Dec. 2, the progressive Occupy Democrats Facebook page posted (archived) an image displaying photos of Noem and Trump. The post's caption read in part, ""Kristi Noem goes full North Korea and thanks Dear Leader for…keeping hurricanes away?"" (Occupy Democrats/Facebook) That post featured a comment from a page manager with a link to video (archived) of Noem's alleged remark. The post's caption continued, in part, as follows: During today's obedience-displaying and shameless a**-kissing convention that the Trump team calls a ""cabinet meeting,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem thanked Trump for keeping hurricanes away. Yes, keeping hurricanes away. ""Sir, you made it through hurricane season without a hurricane. And so FEMA — you even kept the hurricanes away! — And FEMA is deploying resources and dollars 150% faster than ever before. So somebody does have something bad that happens to them, you are immediately there helping them and telling them they have the resources to get back up on their feet."" Clearly, Trump simply took his big black marker and drew arrows telling the hurricanes to go somewhere else! Masterfully done, Mr. President! Publishers and users also shared the claim on Bluesky, Facebook (archived), Instagram (archived), Threads (archived), TikTok (archived), X (archived) and YouTube. In short, the quote was correctly attributed to Noem, who made the remark as an off-the-cuff joke. As the video showed, Noem truly said to Trump, ""Sir, you made it through hurricane season without a hurricane. And so, FEMA, FEMA … you, even you kept the hurricanes away, so we appreciate that."" Noem then continued with her remark about the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which she previously attempted to begin speaking about. Laughs audible in videos from the meeting — as well as the continuation of her FEMA comment — showed the room received Noem's ""you kept the hurricanes away"" remark as nothing more than ad-libbed humor. Snopes contacted DHS and the White House by email to ask about users' claims, including the many posts that did not mention the laughs and the fact that the room received the comment as a joke. We will update this story if we receive further information. The moment in which Noem mentions hurricanes occurs at the 1:24:00 mark in the official White House YouTube channel's video of the Cabinet meeting: The CNBC YouTube channel also features a video showing Trump's reaction to the same comments, beginning at the 1:24:05 mark: USA Today reported no hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. in 2025. In other significant weather events occurring during the year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, along with other elements, combined to form rainfall that resulted in the July flash floods that killed more than 135 people in Texas, including children and adults at summer camps. Also in July, at least six people died in North Caroline as a result of flooding from the remnants of Tropic Storm Chantal. For further reading, we previously reported about other rumors coming out of the same meeting, including the widespread claims that videos showed Trump falling asleep, and that the name card for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth displayed the misspelled title ""Ssecretary of War.""

"Did Megyn Kelly say she wanted to see survivors of strike on alleged drug boat 'suffer'? Written by: Emery Winter Dec. 3, 2025 The Department of Defense reportedly killed two survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat in ... Read More","About this rating Kelly prefaced her defense of the strikes by saying that ""the armed forces should not commit war crimes."" In December 2025, social media users widely shared a clip of Megyn Kelly, a former Fox News host, talking on a podcast about a reported strike by the U.S. military on an alleged drug boat. One post on X (archived) said: Megyn Kelly on alleged war crimes: ""I really do kind of not only wanna see them killed in the water, whether they're on the boat or in the water, but I'd really like to see them suffer. I would like [President Donald] Trump and [Defense Secretary Pete] Hegseth to make it last a long time so they lose a limb and bleed out."" The comment appeared to be in response to recent scrutiny of Hegseth over a report that the military carried out a likely illegal follow-up strike to kill survivors of an initial attack in the Caribbean. Users also shared the quote on Instagram (archived), Reddit (archived) and Bluesky (archived). The quote about seeing ""them killed in the water"" and suffering was correctly attributed to Kelly, who was commenting on reports that the Department of Defense carried out a follow-up strike on survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug boat. Kelly discussed the reported strike on the Dec. 1, 2025, episode of her podcast ""The Megyn Kelly Show."" The quote widely shared across social media came at about 37:17 in the YouTube video of the episode, as she spoke with commentator Mark Halperin. The full context of Kelly's quote, including the commentary on scrutiny around the strikes that the quote was a part of, was as followed (emphasis ours): In any event, it's like to me it's kind of annoying to even debate it. I do think our soldiers and, you know, all armed forces should not commit war crimes. Definitely on team, don't commit a war crime. But I also feel like I object to even the scrutiny of this event because it's all manufactured. It's only being done to retroactively justify this, you know, Seditious Six and their — that's what Hegseth is calling them — and their video which was based on nothing. They're just now digging. It's a fishing expedition and it does feel a little, you know, Stalin's right-hand man-eqsue like, ""Show me the man and I'll show you the crime."" That's how it feels to me, so I'm really not that into it, nor do I really care that we're killing the drug boat guys trying to kill my kids and yours right now by bringing their fentanyl to the United States to try to get our kids when they go to college with, you know, some drug in some moment of weakness where they think they're taking a Xanax like what happened to poor Eric Bowling's child, and instead it's laced with fentanyl. So, I really do kind of not only want to see them killed in the water, whether they're on the boat or in the water, but I'd really like to see them suffer. I would like Trump and Hegseth to make it last a long time so that they lose a limb and bleed out a little — like I'm really having a difficult time ginning up sympathy for these guys who 10 seconds earlier almost got taken out by the initial bomb, but because they managed to get ejected, you know, a little too soon had to be taken out in the water. I realize legally it may make a difference, but truly, Mark, this is a tough case to really gin up the sympathies of the American people. Since September 2025, the Trump administration has carried out a number of strikes in South American waters of the Caribbean Sea against what it has alleged are drug-trafficking boats. In late November, The Washington Post reported that Hegseth gave the order to ""kill everybody"" on a boat the military targeted in the strike in question in September. Once it became evident that two people had survived the initial strike, the commander of the operation ""ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's instructions,"" according to the Post. Since then, Hegseth has acknowledged that U.S. armed forces carried out a follow-up strike on survivors of that initial strike, claiming it occurred due to the ""fog of war."" Members of Congress have scrutinized Hegseth and his role in the reported strikes. The Associated Press reported that several legal experts ""believed the second strike violated peacetime laws and those governing armed conflict."" It also reported that the Department of Defense's manual on the laws of armed conflict specifically cites striking survivors of a sunken ship as being illegal. Under a subsection on the duty of individual members of the armed forces to refuse to comply with ""clearly illegal orders"" to commit war crimes, the manual at the time of the strikes said (Page 1088, emphasis ours): ""The requirement to refuse to comply with orders to commit law of war violations applies to orders to perform conduct that is clearly illegal or orders that the subordinate knows, in fact, are illegal. For example, orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal."" Finley, Ben, et al. ""Welcome to Zscaler Directory Authentication.""

"Do videos show Trump falling asleep during Cabinet meeting? Written by: Jordan Liles Dec. 3, 2025 Users shared videos alleging to show President Trump dozing off and falling asleep during a leng ... Read More","About this rating A rumor that circulated online in early December 2025 claimed a handful of videos showed U.S. President Donald Trump falling asleep at various moments during a White House Cabinet meeting. That meeting, with the video-recorded portion lasting over two hours, took place on Dec. 2. For example, one X user's post (archived) featured a brief clip of Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking during the meeting, seated directly next to Trump's right side. The video, also posted on Reddit (archived), showed Trump opening and fully closing his eyes, and displayed the caption, ""Trump dozes while Marco Rubio speaks to him directly next to him. Just insane optics."" Other users claimed of the same moment that Trump ""fell asleep,"" or used the term ""doze off."" The New York Times shared a video on Bluesky, Facebook and TikTok (archived) from a different moment, showing Trump's eyes opening and slowly closing in a repeated manner — including him nodding to acknowledge remarks — during comments delivered by Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. The Times reported Trump ""appeared to be fighting sleep"" while ""seeming to nod off."" Users reposted another video (archived) highlighting numerous moments in which Trump completely closed his eyes. The first part of the poor-quality clip, featuring Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer speaking about ""Main Street,"" showed Trump's head slightly dropping in the same manner as when a person begins nodding off. The CNBC YouTube channel hosted a higher-quality video of the same moment, occurring from the 1:15:20 to 1:15:30 marks. In short, users' videos truly showed a sleepy Trump during the Cabinet meeting and did not merely show him closing his eyes for quiet reflection or other purposes — as evidenced by the above clips as well as additional footage of him twice yawning (1:34:21-1:34:29) and beginning to fall asleep, including with his head dropping and subsequently coming back up (1:16:07-1:16:30). During the meeting, the drowsy president remained alert to acknowledge speakers' statements, as well as to call on each prominent person seated in the room. Snopes contacted the White House via email and asked if Trump repeatedly dozed off during the meeting, as well as if it had a statement to share about this matter. In response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not answer the specific question of whether Trump repeatedly dozed off. Leavitt told us, in part, ""President Trump was listening attentively and running the entire three-hour marathon Cabinet meeting."" The video-recorded portion of the meeting lasted around 2 hours and 18 minutes, not three hours. It's unclear if she was referencing a private part of a Cabinet meeting occurring prior to the video-recorded portion. Her full statement read as follows: President Trump was listening attentively and running the entire three-hour marathon Cabinet meeting. Just go back and watch his amazing final answer in the press conference, where he ripped into the America-Last Democrats for allowing radical Somali migrants to invade our country and steal from American taxpayers. This epic moment put an exclamation point on President Trump's ninth Cabinet meeting of his second term—all of which have been entirely open to the press for the whole world to see. In all of these historic meetings, the President and his incredible team highlight the exhaustive list of accomplishments they have delivered on behalf of the American people to Make America Great Again. The CNBC YouTube video, with the camera remaining on Trump the entire time, depicted him opening the meeting by speaking for 32 minutes. Toward the middle of the clip, his appearance and posture displayed signs of him becoming drowsy. That drowsiness continued until he continued speaking to wrap up the meeting. At the 1:15:38 mark in the video, Trump wipes his left eye with his left hand, then positions his fingers against his left temple, as captured in photos hosted on the Getty Images website, as well as above this article. The aforementioned additional moment showing him beginning to fall asleep, with his head dropping and then coming back up, occurs around 30-60 seconds later between 1:16:07-1:16:30. Numerous professionally captured still photos also showed Trump's eyes partially or fully closed at various moments during the meeting. While photographers possibly captured those pictures during moments of blinking or momentary eye-closing, the fact remained that videos depicted a drowsy Trump yawning and numerous times slowly dropping his head to begin falling asleep. For further reading, we previously reported about other times users falsely, or without presenting credible evidence, alleged videos showed Trump falling asleep, including while attending Pope Francis' funeral service and during the 2024 Republican National Convention. We also dispelled similar claims regarding videos purportedly depicting former President Joe Biden as dozing off. Kanno-Youngs, Zolan. ""Trump Appears to Fight Sleep During Cabinet Meeting.""

"Pete Hegseth's title was misspelled as 'Ssecretary of War' on nameplate Written by: Nur Ibrahim Dec. 3, 2025 The nameplate was used during President Donald Trump's final White House Cabinet meeting of 2025. Read More","About this rating On Dec. 2, 2025, during the final White House Cabinet meeting of the year, eagle-eyed viewers noticed what appeared to be a curious spelling error on one of the placards. According to images and screenshots shared of the meeting, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's title was misspelled on his placard, reading ""Ssecretary of War."" Snopes readers shared an image of Hegseth seated behind the apparently misspelt placard and asked us to ascertain whether the error was real. Some readers even suggested the ""SS"" was ""giving Nazi."" California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office shared what appeared to be a screenshot from a video of Hegseth speaking with his name card in front of him revealing the apparent spelling error. The office posted the image with the caption: ""What does the 'SS' stand for? Interesting!"" The misspelling was indeed real. We found the error in the footage of the meeting posted by the White House, as well as in photographs published on Getty Images by various photojournalists covering the event. As such, we rate this claim true. The ""SS"" evoking the Nazi Schutzstaffel paramilitary organization in Germany during World War II was likely unintentional. Whatever the reason for the spelling error, other members of the Cabinet did not have such misspellings on their placards. We reached out to the White House to learn more and will update this story if we get more information. We looked closely at the White House's YouTube video of the entire Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. Hegseth's placard is visible at various points during his remarks, and can be seen at the 33:24 mark and after the 35:00 mark when the camera zooms out. Close-up photographs taken by Agence France-Presse photographer Andrew Caballero-Reynolds and Getty Images photographer Chip Somodevilla showed the misspelling more clearly. The AFP photograph caption states: The word Secretary is misspelled on the nameplate of US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during a Cabinet Meeting hosted by President Donald Trump in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, DC on December 2, 2025. (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images) (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Hegseth was defending the September 2025 U.S. follow-up missile strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea, which reportedly had shipwrecked survivors. During the Cabinet meeting, Hegseth said he did not watch the entire operation or ""personally see survivors"" but said a second strike that sank the boat was ""the right call"" and part of the ""fog of war."" Trump issued an executive order in September 2025 to rebrand the Department of Defense as the Department of War, though legally renaming it requires an act of Congress. We have reported on numerous claims about Hegseth, including the rumor he authored a memo canceling the military's support of Scouting America because the Scouts no longer promoted ""masculine values"" and the satirical claim that he poked his own eye with a mascara brush.

"Newly released Epstein island photos include image showing old man masks on walls Written by: Rae Deng Dec. 3, 2025 The photo showed the masks surrounding what looked like a dentist's chair. Read More","About this rating In early December 2025, social media users claimed an image of a room that housed what appeared to be a dentist's chair surrounded by masks of older men on the walls came from the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's private island in the Caribbean. The rumor spread on X, Facebook and Reddit. In short, the claim was true. House Oversight Committee Democrats released the image on Dec. 2 alongside a trove of photos and videos from ""Epstein's Island"" in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (While Epstein owned both Great St. James and Little St. James islands, ""Epstein Island"" generally refers to Little St. James.) The committee received the images in response to a Nov. 18 request for additional Epstein investigation files from the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Justice. According to the Oversight Democrats, these images had not been publicly released before their announcement. Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial, according to the FBI. While social media users speculated about who was depicted among the masks, Oversight Democrats did not release any additional information about the photos, and it was impossible to definitively tell whether they represented any particular people. Other images released showed a chalkboard with various scribblings on it and a landline phone with speed-dial contacts, some of which had been redacted. In late 2025, lawmakers passed legislation to release additional files related to the investigation into Epstein, which President Donald Trump signed Nov. 19. As of this writing, the Department of Justice has yet to release those files. In a Dec. 3 letter, five lawmakers from both parties and chambers asked Attorney General Pam Bondi for a status update ""in light of the short 30 day deadline to release the Epstein Files,"" as outlined in the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

"Beware of claim DNA testing proved Prince Harry isn't King Charles III's son Written by: Laerke Christensen Dec. 3, 2025 Speculation about his parentage has dogged the Duke of Sussex throughout his life, but an AI-gen ... Read More","About this rating In November and December 2025, a claim (archived) circulated online that Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, went ""off the rails"" in court after a DNA test revealed he was not King Charles III's son. For example, on Nov. 30, 2025, one Facebook page posted a video that appeared to show Harry screaming as two people struggled to restrain him. The video caption read, ""Prince Harry Goes Off the Rails in Court After Dismissing DNA Test: 'My mother didn't lie…'"" Other Facebook users shared the same claim (archived, archived, archived). Some of those posts featured links in top comments leading to advertisement-filled articles hosted by WordPress blogs. Snopes readers also wrote in, asking if the claim was true. Searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo found no news media outlets reporting that Harry had taken a DNA test that showed the king was not his father (archived, archived, archived, archived). Prominent news media outlets would have widely reported this rumor, if true. Additionally, though the video implied that some news media were allowed to witness Harry receiving the results of the alleged DNA test, we found no other photos of the event from reputable picture agencies like Getty Images that would have covered the event it if actually happened. The video itself showed signs of the use of artificial intelligence. Given the above, we rate this claim false. The video that accompanied the claim on Facebook postings appeared to be fake and had likely been generated using AI. For example, though the person in the video showed a passing resemblance to Harry, recent photos from Getty Images showed the prince has blue eyes, while the video showed ""Harry"" with dark eyes. The badge on the arm of the law enforcement official who appeared to restrain ""Harry"" (time code 0:02) did not appear to use letters from any known alphabet. Nonsense writing is a common sign of AI use in pictures and videos. Additionally, the sound in the video was out of sync, as the sound of ""Harry's"" scream came before his face appeared to make the corresponding expression. Though this particular claim was false, Harry has long faced speculation about his parentage. He wrote in his 2023 autobiography, ""Spare,"" that ""nearly every biography of me, every longish profile in a paper or magazine"" touched on the long-standing rumor that Harry was the son of James Hewitt, a British cavalry officer who reportedly saw Harry's mother, Princess Diana, for five years in the late 1980s. Harry wrote in his memoir that Charles never addressed this rumor with him and that, ""If Pa had any thoughts about Major Hewitt, he kept them to himself."" Hewitt told the Sunday Mirror in 2002 that he was not Harry's father, citing as evidence that Harry was ""already a toddler"" by the time he and Diana met in 1986. Harry was born Sept. 15, 1984. Ken Wharfe, Diana's former bodyguard, reportedly corroborated Hewitt's claim in his 2002 book, ""Diana: Closely Guarded Secret."" Wharfe wrote that ""Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986, and the red hair, gossips so love to cite as proof is, of course, a Spencer trait."" (Spencer was Diana's maiden name.) For further reading, Snopes previously reported on true claims that Harry partied with Diddy and Ye and dressed up as a Nazi for another party. We also looked into a claim that the BBC called ""Spare"" the ""weirdest book ever written by a royal."" Communications Security Establishment.

"Rashida Tlaib didn't call for Hamas supporters to mobilize and take over America Written by: Jack Izzo Dec. 3, 2025 Online posts took a speech Tlaib delivered at the 2025 People's Conference for Palestine out of ... Read More","About this rating The claim was spread by pro-Israel users on social media, who often equate support for Palestine with support for the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is a designated terrorist organization in the U.S. Between Aug. 29 and 31, 2025, a group of Palestinian organizations hosted the ""2025 People's Conference for Palestine"" in Detroit. According to the conference's website, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat who is herself the daughter of Palestinian immigrants to the U.S., delivered a speech toward the end of the conference. Throughout the following months, with an uptick of posts in late November 2025, accounts of Tlaib's speech spread across social media. The posts claimed that Tlaib had called on supporters of Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that the U.S. government has designated a terrorist organization, to ""mobilize and take over America."" That claim was false. Snopes viewed Tlaib's speech on YouTube. Nowhere in her speech did Tlaib call on supporters of Hamas to ""mobilize and take over America."" Instead, Tlaib's speech called for members of the public who oppose the acts of the Israeli military in Gaza to ""mobilize."" She and many experts — including the United Nations and Amnesty International — have described those acts as a genocide. The claim relies on rhetoric that commonly pops up in discussions about the war in Gaza. Supporters of Israel sometimes equate support for the civilian population in Palestine and opposition to genocide with support for Hamas. Some critics describe that as a false equivalence. Many clips of Tlaib's speech contained watermarks for Canary Mission, an anonymously run website that The New York Times described as doxing (sharing someone's personal details for the purpose of public shaming and ridicule) people and organizations it considers to ""promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews."" The article noted that many of the people targeted on the Canary site are students and university professors who have been ""active in campus protests against Israeli government policies."" Below is a transcript of the two most relevant excerpts from Tlaib's speech: They will never truly comprehend, even after seven decades, that we aren't going anywhere. We are just getting started. I want to say to all of them — every genocide enabler — look at this room, motherf*****s, we ain't going anywhere! We are just growing and growing and growing. We are bringing siblings from other movements with us. Every corner of this city that raised me has shown me how to fight for civil rights and justice and against oppression. It'll show you, because I want you to be truly present in this city that gave me strength, it's not not just ""dammi falastiniyah"" [Arabic for ""my blood is Palestinian""], it's that as an American, this city taught me, taught me that the political structures that I have to work in, that we all are surrounded by, was built on slavery and genocide and rape and oppression. Detroit taught me that these institutions will never save us. Detroit will remind me constantly that community mothers, that it's not the genocide-enabling Congress or the White House that will free our people; it is only us, it can only be us. So thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible courage. This is the least we can do — is show up. The least we can do to try and save lives. Enabling the genocide in Gaza and dismantling the apartheid system that oppresses Palestinians unifies so many different struggles, you've all seen it. For freedom and justice at home and abroad. […] I know it can feel overwhelmingly bleak some times — you feel helpless — imagine me in Congress. We have watched for the very first time all of us, in our lifetimes, a live-streamed genocide on our phones for nearly two years. We have been lied to — gaslit by a Democratic president and now a Republican president. Both parties vote time and time again to fund one of the worst crimes in history. But I need you to understand this — and believe it, because I'm there in the front seat watching — outside of the decaying halls of the empire in Washington, D.C., we are winning. They [Congress] are scared. They are scared! They send me videos and messages of people protesting in front of their district offices, people showing up at their town halls, and I was like, ""We're not all related, I don't know why you're sending it to me. Those are fellow Americans that may not share my faith or ethnicity showing up. Maybe you should meet with them and listen to them and not AIPAC [the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group]. They elected you."" Real change doesn't come from the cowards and warmongers in Congress. It comes from the streets, it comes from all of us mobilizing and seizing the power to resist and fight back. Every town hall they hold, somebody is showing up, asking, ""Why is the United States funding a genocide? Why haven't you, my representative in Congress, done anything to stop it?""

"False story about fire hoses running dry during 1963 Birmingham Civil Rights protests spreads online Written by: Joey Esposito Dec. 3, 2025 A popular rumor circulating online couched a fake inspirational tale within real world context. Read More","About this rating A claim making the rounds online in November 2025 purported that fire hoses mysteriously turned off or ran dry during the high-profile Civil Rights Movement protests in Birmingham, Alabama, in May 1963, in which city officials used police dogs and fire hoses to drive back protesters. Users on social media, primarily on Facebook (archived, archived, archived), shared the story along with a purported photograph of the moment allegedly dubbed ""The Night the Firehoses Ran Dry,"" depicting a group of children walking through a flooded street past firefighters holding hoses pouring water at low pressure. The rumor circulated following months of protests against the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Posts sharing the claim also included an alleged sequence of events: The Night the Firehoses Ran Dry Birmingham, Alabama – May 4, 1963 (the day after the dogs refused) Bull Connor, furious that the dogs had failed, ordered every firehose in the city turned on the children full force. At 1:14 p.m. the valves were opened wide. Water shot out for exactly seven feet, then fell straight to the ground like rain. No pressure. No spray. Just soft streams that soaked shoes but never knocked anyone down. Firemen twisted valves harder. Nothing. The hoses stayed gentle. The children walked forward, singing, and the water parted around them like a curtain. When the last child passed Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, the hoses suddenly roared back to full power, almost ripping the nozzles from the firemen's hands. The city water department tore up streets for weeks looking for the ""valve malfunction."" They never found one. Every May 4 at 1:14 p.m., the fire hydrants along Kelly Ingram Park leak a few drops, even when capped tight. Old men who were children that day still come, put their palms under the drip, and say the water still tastes like freedom. There is no evidence that ""The Night the Firehoses Ran Dry"" was an actual event that occurred on May 4, 1963. Rather, it appeared to be made up. The image that circulated alongside it, generated with artificial intelligence (AI), appeared designed to trick readers into thinking the story was authentic by couching it within actual historical context of a key point in the Civil Rights movement dubbed the ""Children's Crusade."" As a result, we've rated the claim false. Snopes reached out to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) and Kids in Birmingham 1963, a nonprofit organization focused on collecting ""dozens and dozens of first-person accounts of what happened in Birmingham during 1963 and in the months that followed,"" for further confirmation that the story and image do not represent a real event. We will update this article if we receive a response. On May 2, 1963, ""more than one thousand students skipped classes and gathered at 16th Street Baptist Church to march to downtown Birmingham, Alabama"" in support of the Civil Rights movement — specifically an effort to desegregate Birmingham — according to the NMAAHC. According to a page on the museum's website, the initial protest resulted in hundreds of arrests and ""hundreds more young people"" amassing the following day near Kelly Ingram Park on May 3, 1963, when ""white commissioner, Bull Connor, directed the local police and fire departments to use force to halt the demonstration."" The New York Times ran a report the following day that featured photographs from the events in Birmingham, including a police dog lunging at a young protester and a fireman dousing protesters with a fire hose under the headline, ""Dogs and Hoses Repulse Negroes at Birmingham."" The date social media posts gave for the purported turning off of said fire hoses, May 4, 1963, would place it on the third day of the Children's Crusade, but there is no evidence the episode it happened. In fact, a front page headline of The New York Times on May 5, 1963, proclaimed, ""U.S. Seeking a Truce in Birmingham; Hoses Again Drive Off Demonstrators."" The same article stated, ""Demonstrations by Negroes seeking the lowering of racial barriers continued with fierce intensity. Firemen again used fire hoses, turning them on groups of Negro spectators who disregarded police orders to disperse."" According to the NMAAHC website, the conflict between Birmingham law enforcement and young protesters resulted in ""images of children being blasted by high-pressure fire hoses, being clubbed by police officers, and being attacked by police dogs appeared on television and in newspapers, and triggered outrage throughout the world."" (The New York Times) A May 10, 1963, news report by CBS News, viewable on the Library of Congress website, offered substantial film footage of the fire hoses in action as well as an interview with Martin Luther King Jr., one of the organizers of the ongoing campaign to fight segregation in Birmingham at the time. A retrospective report on the events of 1963 in Birmingham, published by Alabama News Center in 2023, said, ""Firemen earlier had reported that the water hose pressure was 50 to 100 pounds per inch. They turned the hoses on full blast and aimed directly at the youngsters, several of whom were skinned up as they skidded down the gutters under the intense water pressure."" Alabama News Center reported a comment from protester Carolyn Maull McKinstry, who stated she was 15 in 1963. ""The water hoses hurt a lot…. The water tore a big hole in my sweater and swiped part of my hair off on that side,"" McKinstry said. ""I just remember the sting and the pain on my face. It was very painful, and you couldn't escape. There were a few points where we were trying to stand up and hold onto a wall. It was just a terrific pain from the force."" ""Despite the violence, children continued to march and protest in an organizing action now known as the Children's Crusade,"" the NMAAHC website said of the May 1963 demonstrations. ""The crusade ended after intervention from the U.S. Department of Justice. The event moved President John F. Kennedy to express support for federal civil rights legislation and the eventual passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."" While there is no evidence that a mysterious benefactor assisted the demonstrators by turning down the water pressure of the fire hoses being used to disperse protesters, as the rumor suggested, there was backlash to the use of force at the time. In 2015, Alabama news website AL.com reported that ""a New York fire fighters union issued a resolution in July 1963, saying the liberty of the black people in Birmingham was denied and it was wrong the way the Birmingham fire fighters were 'misused.' The resolution, issued by the Uniformed Fire Officers Association of New York, Local 854, called Birmingham's conduct 'shameful' and 'deplorable,' and has brought 'discredit to the honorable status of professional fire fighters.''' However, the resolution went mostly unknown to Birmingham locals until 2014, when activists ""were invited to New York City to commemorate the 51st anniversary of that march in Kelly Ingram Park"" and presented a copy of the document. One of the invited activists said, ""It made me feel like what we did was worth the risk we took because Eugene Connor had led us to believe that everything we did, everyone in the world, was against it."" (As Birmingham's commissioner of public safety at the time, Eugene ""Bull"" Connor was the public face of the force used against the protesters.) Regarding the image that circulated with the story, AI-detection platform Hive Moderation declared a 99.9% chance that someone created it using AI. (Hive Moderation) While such platforms are not always accurate, keen-eyed readers can note illegible gibberish displayed on the signs in the backgrounds of the purported photo, one surefire indicator of AI-generated slop. In addition, there are a host of distorted faces among the alleged children, particularly the figures in the background. Lastly, a reverse-image Google search of the purported photographs showed no results earlier than November 2025. Had the photo been authentic, it undoubtedly would have been widely reported at the time and included in subsequent reporting about the protests in Birmingham. This particular story resembled ""glurge,"" which Snopes has previously defined as ""sentimental or heart-rending story that undermines its own inspirational message by distorting — or ignoring — the facts."" In this instance, the individual or individuals who created the glurge borrowed real elements of the Children's Crusade and the general unrest of the Civil Rights Movement to concoct a heartwarming, but entirely false, take on a tumultuous moment in American history. 1963 Timeline | Kids In Birmingham 1963. https://kidsinbirmingham1963.org/1963-timeline/.

"Did Tony Hawk and Henry Rollins launch retirement home for aging punks? Written by: Rae Deng Dec. 2, 2025 Don't expect to see ollies at the old folks' home anytime soon. Read More","About this rating In late 2025, a rumor spread online that legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk and punk icon Henry Rollins started a retirement home for aging punks and skaters. Posts about the alleged place to ""slow down…without calming down"" primarily circulated on Facebook. This rumor started with a Dec. 1, 2025, post from Pleatherface Lives, an artist's Facebook account. Pleatherface Lives' ""Intro"" notes that the artist also uses the page as ""a dump for memes I find funny and Satire Stories."" While Pleatherface Lives did not clearly mark the post itself as a joke, they responded to several comments underneath it that confirmed the rumor's satirical nature. The account also confirmed that the post was ""just for laughs"" in a Facebook direct message to Snopes. As such, this claim originated as satire. For example, one commenter referenced ""Mattersville,"" a song by punk band NOFX about growing old together with the lyrics, ""A neighborhood for punks over the hill / We'll spend our golden years in Mattersville."" Pleatherface Lives responded: ""It was 100% the inspiration lol was stoned listening to nofx working on some art commissions and was like this would be a funny satire article."" In the comments, Pleatherface Lives also posted a design for a T-shirt with four black bars — a reference to the logo of Rollins' former band, Black Flag. One of the bars showed a person's back and the T-shirt read, ""BACK HURTS."" In case you were wondering, Hawk is 57 and Rollins is 64 as of this writing — so they're both eligible for the 55-plus retirement community life, although both were still actively working on projects.

"Video shows Muslims praying on Brooklyn street at 5 a.m.? Written by: Jordan Liles Dec. 2, 2025 (Updated: Dec. 3, 2025) Users claimed the video depicted Muslims ""trying to assert their religious dominance over you, c ... Read More","About this rating While the video truly showed Muslims gathering for prayer in Brooklyn and did not feature any signs of artificial-intelligence manipulation, the user who captured the video did not record the clip at 5 a.m. The video depicted one of several other daytime prayers. Users' other claims — alleging the Muslims peacefully praying in the video were ""trying to assert their religious dominance over you, claim your country and turn it into Sharia law"" — were unfounded. A rumor that circulated online in late November and early December 2025 claimed a video showed Muslims participating in a Fajr (dawn) prayer at 5 a.m. in the middle of a one-way street in Brooklyn, New York, with the audible voice of an imam guiding the congregants. For example, on Nov. 30, an X user posted (archived) the video, captioned, ""At 5am in Brooklyn, NY, Muslims perform the first of 5 prayers for the day, called the Fajr,"" receiving well over 5 million views. The user also included an alleged quote claiming followers of Islam are ""trying to assert their religious dominance over you, claim your country and turn it into Sharia law"" — referencing Shariah, Islamic law that governs Muslims' personal conduct and legal matters. Other users posted similar captions with the video, or a screenshot from the clip, on Facebook (archived), Instagram (archived), Threads (archived) and X (archived). Other users claimed someone recorded the video not in New York but instead in Toronto, posted about the congregants ""blocking traffic"" and alleged the clip depicted ""Muslim immigrants."" A Snopes reader also emailed us to ask about the clip. In short, the video was real but users shared captions featuring misleading and unfounded information, which we detail below: The clip truly showed Muslims gathering for prayers in Brooklyn and did not feature any signs of artificial-intelligence manipulation or other video fakery. Snopes' comprehensive search of Google Street View for nearly every Islamic center and mosque in the borough found a match: the Masjid Omar, also known as the Islamic Center of Brighton Beach, at 232 Neptune Ave. in the Brighton Beach neighborhood. The oldest online posting of the clip Snopes could find, located with a reverse-image search, was a TikTok post (archived) at 3:12 p.m. Eastern time Nov. 21, 2025. Snopes did not yet determine the exact date and time when the video was recorded. Whoever captured the clip did not record it at 5 a.m., nor during prayers at Fajr — an Arabic word for dawn, with Fajr prayers happening during predawn hours — as users' posts with tens of millions of collective views alleged. The city's earliest sunrise of 2025, happening in June, occurred at 5:24 a.m. — well before the daylight depicted in the clip. (Fajr prayers that day were at 3:45 a.m.) The clip, therefore, depicted one of several other daytime prayers, either in November 2025 or some earlier time. Online searches for reporting about similar public Muslim prayers found past gatherings in Times Square, Washington Square Park and Bedford-Stuyvesant, for example. Snopes contacted the Masjid Omar by email and phone to ask about the video. We also privately messaged the TikTok user who shared the clip on Nov. 21 and will update this story if we receive further information. Users' other claims — alleging the Muslims peacefully praying in the video were ""trying to assert their religious dominance over you, claim your country and turn it into Sharia law"" — were unfounded. Some users responding to the aforementioned posts mentioned Islamophobia, either in a positive or negative light. An article (archived) hosted by the National Library of Medicine website, published near the end of U.S. President Barack Obama's administration, defined the term as follows: ""Islamophobia is conceptualized as social stigma toward Islam and Muslims, dislike of Muslims as a political force, and a distinct construct referring to anti-Muslim stereotypes, racism, or xenophobia."" Users shared the video and claim in the days following the Nov. 26 shooting of two National Guard troops near the White House. An Afghan national faced first-degree murder and assault charges in the death of Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and wounding of Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24. The Associated Press, citing a police report filed in court, reported that another National Guard member heard gunshots and saw Beckstrom and Wolfe fall to the ground as the suspect fired a gun and screamed, ""Allahu Akbar!"" For further reading, we previously investigated an AI-generated video that users falsely claimed authentically showed a woman wearing a hijab in a school classroom instructing white British children to bow and say ""Allahu Akbar.""

"Is Harrison Ford starring in live-action 'Up' remake? Written by: Jack Izzo Dec. 2, 2025 Disney hasn't said anything about a new version of the beloved animated film. Read More","About this rating A rumor that circulated online in November 2025 that Harrison Ford would star in an upcoming live-action version of the animated film ""Up"" as the film's main character, Carl Fredricksen. Snopes readers emailed us to ask whether the rumor was true. However, there was no evidence to support the rumor that Disney and Pixar were working on a live-action version of ""Up"" starring Harrison Ford. The claim was false. Searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo found no news media outlets reporting about the live-action remake, and it did not have a page on IMDb. Prominent entertainment outlets (and fan blogs dedicated to covering Disney's activities) would have reported on the project if it were legitimate. Instead, Snopes found several ""trailers"" for the supposed movie on YouTube that were generated by artificial-intelligence tools. The purported trailers contained obvious signs of AI generation, including an inhuman voice-over, fotoage of Ford moving in an unnatural manner and camera shots with strange focal effects. Fake movie posters and trailers are commonplace online, and generative AI tools have allowed users to create a significantly higher volume of them, generally looking receive advertising revenue if the social media post goes viral. Snopes has covered other fake movie trailers in the past, including a supposed live-action ""Simpsons"" movie starring Adam Sandler and a James Bond movie starring Henry Cavill. Izzo, Jack.

"Don't believe claim Trump said MRI scan on his brain 'found nothing' Written by: Taija PerryCook Dec. 2, 2025 Trump underwent MRI scanning in October 2025, but the scan reportedly didn't include his brain. Read More","About this rating Trump did have an MRI scan in October 2025, but it was reportedly on his cardiovascular system and abdominal area, not his brain. In December 2025, a rumor that U.S. President Donald Trump announced an MRI scan of his brain ""found nothing"" circulated online (archived): WASHINGTON—Boasting about his cognitive health, on Monday Donald J. Trump asserted than an MRI performed on his brain found nothing. ""I had a perfect MRI,"" he told reporters. ""The greatest doctors in the country looked at my brain and came up empty."" Trump said there was no point in releasing his MRI because ""there's nothing to see,"" adding, ""It's like the East Wing."" The claim appeared amid increasing calls for Trump to release the results of an MRI he underwent in October 2025. The White House released a memo Dec. 1 that said Trump's cardiovascular and abdominal imaging was ""perfectly normal,"" according to his doctor, Sean Barbabella. When a reporter asked Trump on Dec. 1 what part of the body the MRI was looking at, he said, ""I have no idea … it wasn't the brain because I took a cognitive test and I aced it."" Variations of the rumor that Trump said an MRI scan of his brain ""found nothing"" spread on Reddit (archived), Facebook and TikTok (archived), and Snopes readers asked about the authenticity of the claim. Some readers seemed to interpret the rumor as a factual recounting of real-life events. However, there was no evidence Trump announced an MRI scan on his brain ""found nothing."" Rather, the rumor originated with The Borowitz Report (archived) — a site that describes its output as satirical in nature. Its author, Andy Borowitz, wrote on its About page: ""I've been writing satirical news since I was eighteen. This represents either commitment to a genre or arrested development."" The New Yorker featured The Borowitz Report as a column for 25 years. Borowitz announced in 2023 that the magazine dropped his column for financial reasons. He then returned to publishing his satirical stories on his own website and social media pages. If a U.S. president had actually publicly made this statement about an MRI, major news media outlets would have reported it. However, a Google search of the keywords ""Trump Claims MRI on His Brain Found Nothing"" generated results related only to the satirical story in question. (Google.com) Snopes has addressed similar satirical claims stemming from The Borowitz Report in the past, including the assertion that the U.S. Navy struck Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' yacht near Venezuela and a rumor that billionaire George Soros filed for bankruptcy after funding ""No Kings"" protests.

"Did Trump ally Mike Davis swear at Gabby Giffords after she posted about slain National Guard member? Written by: Megan Loe Dec. 2, 2025 Giffords was severely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting, leaving her with a traumatic brain injury ... Read More","About this rating In late November 2025, social media users (archived here, here and here) claimed that lawyer Mike Davis, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, told former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords to ""f*** off"" on X in response to her post about Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, a 20-year-old National Guard member fatally shot that month in Washington, D.C. Several people who shared the claim pointed out that Giffords was a victim of gun violence. The former congresswoman was severely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting that killed six people and injured a dozen others, leaving her with a traumatic brain injury that affected her movement and speech. According to the social media posts, Davis shared the profanity-laced post shown below in response to Giffords offering her condolences to Beckstrom's loved ones and calling for action against gun violence. Multiple Snopes readers searched our website and emailed us to confirm whether Davis really made the post. Those words were correctly attributed to Davis. He posted that message from his verified X account (archived) on Nov. 28 in response to the following message that Giffords posted (archived) that day: Specialist Sarah Beckstrom deserved a long, full life. My heart is with her family, friends, and fellow servicemembers. Gun violence steals too many futures. We must honor her by fighting for a safer country—one where all Americans are protected from gun violence. Specialist Sarah Beckstrom deserved a long, full life. My heart is with her family, friends, and fellow servicemembers. Gun violence steals too many futures. We must honor her by fighting for a safer country—one where all Americans are protected from gun violence. https://t.co/yOEQWUIxyk — Gabrielle Giffords (@GabbyGiffords) November 28, 2025 In response, Davis wrote: Gun violence??? F*** off, Gabby. The real problem is your piece-of-s*** husband @SenMarkKelly and other Democrats, who mass-import terrorists, demonize the National Guard members saving cities, and call on 18-year-old enlistees to disobey the President of the United States. Snopes could not immediately reach Davis for comment. Davis is the founder and president of the conservative advocacy group The Article III Project. He previously served as chief counsel for nominations, advising Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and other senators on the confirmation of federal judges and executive branch appointees, according to his bio on the organization's website. A vocal supporter of Trump and his policies, Davis has also reportedly served as an informal adviser to Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top administration officials, ABC News reported. In his reply to Giffords, Davis appeared to refer to a Nov. 18 video shared on Facebook (archived) in which six Democratic members of Congress, including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona — Giffords' husband — urged U.S. service members to ""refuse illegal orders."" The lawmakers did not reference any specific orders that they deemed illegal. As Snopes previously reported, Trump accused the Democratic lawmakers of ""seditious behavior"" that was ""punishable by death"" in a post on his Truth Social platform. He also referred to them as ""traitors to the country"" and said they should ""be arrested and put on trial"" (archived).

"Did Alyssa Milano write this open letter criticizing Marjorie Taylor Greene? Written by: Megan Loe Dec. 2, 2025 Though letters like these are sometimes misattributed to public figures, Milano's to Greene was ... Read More","About this rating In late November 2025, social media users claimed (archived here, here, here and here) that actor and activist Alyssa Milano wrote an open letter to U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., criticizing the congresswoman's longstanding support for President Donald Trump despite Greene breaking from his administration on several issues in the second half of 2025. On Nov. 21, Greene announced (archived) she would resign from Congress effective Jan. 5, 2026. Her decision followed a public falling-out with Trump (archived, archived) over his stance on releasing files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and broader disagreements over foreign affairs and health care policy. According to the social media posts, Milano's purported letter, dated Nov. 17, began: Congresswoman Greene, Let's skip the pleasantries. They were never your thing anyway. So…you've suddenly discovered that Donald Trump, the man you treated like a messiah, is not loyal and that the MAGA movement is not safe, not sane, and certainly not rooted in anything constitutional. And you're shocked that he's attacking you, endangering you, calling you a traitor. As if you didn't know he had it in him. Puh-lease. Here's the part you don't get to skip: You helped create this monster. You fed it. You protected it. You celebrated it. And now that it's finally turning on you, you want sympathy? Understanding? A moment of national concern? No. Absolutely not. NOPE. Because letters and statements are sometimes misattributed to public figures, multiple Snopes readers emailed us and searched our website to verify whether the letter was accurately attributed to Milano. In this instance, the actor did write the letter. Milano posted links to it on her verified Facebook (archived) and Instagram (archived) accounts. She published the full letter in a Nov. 17 post on her verified Substack (archived) with text that matched what people shared on social media. In her letter, Milano criticized Greene for what she described as empowering Trump's Make America Great Again movement and then objecting when she became a target. She also argued that Greene's call to release the Epstein files was driven by ""fear"" rather than ""courage."" Milano concluded the letter by calling for Greene's ""public, unequivocal accountability"" if she wants ""redemption,"" writing that ""real accountability means going fully public with everything you know, every lie, every scheme, every threat, every abuse of power you witnessed, tolerated, or assisted."" The full text of Milano's open letter was as follows (emphasis hers): Congresswoman Greene, Let's skip the pleasantries. They were never your thing anyway. So…you've suddenly discovered that Donald Trump, the man you treated like a messiah, is not loyal and that the MAGA movement is not safe, not sane, and certainly not rooted in anything constitutional. And you're shocked that he's attacking you, endangering you, calling you a traitor. As if you didn't know he had it in him. Puh-lease. Here's the part you don't get to skip: You helped create this monster. You fed it. You protected it. You celebrated it. And now that it's finally turning on you, you want sympathy? Understanding? A moment of national concern? No. Absolutely not. NOPE. You don't get to unleash political poison into the bloodstream of American politics and then act surprised when it reaches your own veins. You don't get to cheer on Trump while he smears, threatens, and dehumanizes everyone in his way, and then clutch your fake pearls when he finally does it to you. You don't get to empower a movement built on conspiracy, cruelty, and violence, and then cry foul when you become its latest target. Let's be honest, you calling for the release of the Epstein Files, isn't courage. It's fear. You don't suddenly care about truth or justice. And you definitely don't care about the victims. You are calling for the release of the files because you're afraid of what unchecked power looks like when it's no longer aimed at your enemies. The Epstein case is a perfect cultural lightning-rod and your supporters love that shit. You saw the polls and are reacting accordingly. Jump off the sinking MAGA ship, am I right, MTG? Now you're talking about accountability and transparency. Ha! Where was that energy on January 6th? Where was your outrage when Trump incited a mob to storm the Capitol? When they hunted Democratic lawmakers through hallways? When they called for the hanging of the Vice President? When police officers were beaten, crushed, and traumatized doing their jobs? Where was your moral clarity then, MTG? Where was your voice when Democratic governors were receiving kidnapping threats? When election workers were doxxed and terrorized? When a man broke into Nancy Pelosi's home with a hammer and nearly killed her husband? When threats against Democrats, judges, school boards, and public servants skyrocketed? You said nothing. And this isn't new behavior. You chased a Parkland school-shooting survivor, David Hogg, down a Washington sidewalk, taunting him and calling him a ""coward."" You screamed through President Biden's State of the Union address like you were the most unprofessional person to ever be elected into office. You voted against the Frederick Douglass Human Trafficking Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, (one of only twenty members of Congress to oppose a bipartisan bill designed to help trafficking victims). You amplified QAnon conspiracies. You suggested school shootings were staged. And while Democrats were being targeted, when a militia plotted to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and when Governor Josh Shapiro's home was set on fire in an arson attack with his family inside, you offered no outrage, no sympathy, no defense of democracy. I could go on. But I think you get the picture, Congresswomen. I'm not buying it. If you want redemption. If you want to step into the light, there is only one door: Public, unequivocal accountability. Not the performative kind with hair and make-up. Not the ""Trump hurt my feelings"" kind. Not the victimhood you've perfected. Real accountability means going fully public with everything you know, every lie, every scheme, every threat, every abuse of power you witnessed, tolerated, or assisted. If you want redemption, start with the truth. All of it. Until then, this isn't a moral awakening. It's simply the consequences of your own choices arriving right on schedule. Sincerely, Alyssa Milano Snopes contacted Greene's office for comment on the open letter and will update this story if we receive a response. Milano has openly criticized Republican politicians — particularly Trump — and their supporters for years. In January 2019, it was widely reported that she posted a message on X (then Twitter) comparing the MAGA hat to the hood worn by members of the Ku Klux Klan. The alleged tweet had been deleted or removed at the time of publication (Milano reportedly deactivated her X account in late 2024). For further reading, we also unpacked a claim that Greene wanted to run for president in 2028 — a rumor that she rejected as ""baseless gossip.""

"Did Obama and Buttigieg really drop 'Project Unity'? Here's the truth Written by: Megan Loe Dec. 1, 2025 Posts claimed Obama and Buttigieg spoke publicly about the plan, citing ""C-SPAN cameras"" that su ... Read More","About this rating In November 2025, a rumor circulated on social media (archived) that former U.S. President Barack Obama and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, both Democrats, unveiled a plan called ""Project Unity"" that boosted support for political candidates from their party. The posts claimed Obama and Buttigieg spoke publicly about the plan, citing ""C-SPAN cameras"" that supposedly zoomed in on Obama during the announcement. They also attributed the following quote to Buttigieg: ""Donald calls it chaos. We call it a crossroads. This project is our blueprint: secure borders without cruelty, jobs without exploitation. And if Washington can't get it done — we will."" According to the posts, the clip trended on X and caused Democrats to surge 16 points in ""battlegrounds"" or ""swing states."" (JohnLennon Fan Club via Facebook) One of the posts also included a link in the comments to an advertisement-filled article about the alleged collaboration between Obama and Buttigieg. However, there was no evidence as of this writing that the politicians had publicly announced a plan called ""Project Unity."" As such, we've rated this claim false. A search of the C-SPAN website (archived) didn't return any videos of the two discussing the supposed blueprint. Likewise, searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo turned up no credible news reports supporting the claim. Since Obama and Buttigieg are public figures, reputable media outlets would have likely reported on such a collaboration. Yahoo's AI Summary, however, claimed Obama and Buttigieg were collaborating on the project, citing a Facebook post that shared the false rumor (archived). Artificial intelligence tools like this one can be unreliable and may inadvertently contribute to the spread of misinformation. Snopes reached out to the Obama Foundation for comment and will update this story if we receive a response. While it's unclear who authored the posts, they are part of a trend of false stories about celebrities and politicians shared on social media. The story was seemingly written to generate advertising revenue for external websites or to boost engagement on social media. Like other posts that spread similar false rumors, both the text and at least one image appeared to have been AI-generated. For example, the AI-detection tool GPTZero indicated it was ""highly confident"" that the text in one of the Facebook posts was AI-generated, though it's worth noting these types of tools are not always accurate. (GPTZero AI-detection tool) We independently identified signs of AI generation. For example, the text contained over-the-top, emotionally charged language, such as ""48 seconds of White House fire that might seal Dems the crown in 2028"" and ""like a loaded gun."" This type of language is often found in AI-generated content designed to elicit strong reactions and drive engagement. The description of Project Unity was also plausible but generic: ""Rebuilding borders, economy and trust."" AI often invents concepts that sound like they could be real but don't actually exist. An analysis of an image used in one of the posts (archived) spreading the false story also indicated that it was likely created with AI. The AI-detection platform Sightengine estimated a 99% probability that the image, which appeared to show Obama and Buttigieg shaking hands, was AI-generated. Hive, another AI-detection platform, similarly flagged the image as likely containing ""AI-generated or deepfake content."" We also noted telltale signs of AI generation, such as unnaturally smooth skin and awkward body positioning. (Hive AI detector) Other evidence also raised red flags about the Facebook posts' claims. For example, page transparency tabs for two of the Facebook pages (archived here and here) that shared the false claim about Obama and Buttigieg revealed that most of their page owners were based in Vietnam — a country that has repeatedly appeared in research into fabricated, AI-generated stories tied to major news events and public figures. A separate Facebook page shared a nearly identical story (archived) about Obama and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas. Notably, that post also mentioned a plan called ""Project Unity"" and included an image that was likely AI-generated. Its page managers also were based in Vietnam (archived). For further reading, we debunked a claim that the Department of Government Efficiency stopped an annual multimillion-dollar payment to Obama for ""royalties associated with Obamacare."" ""GPTZero.""

"Rumor about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce donations for baby with cancer and orphanage doesn't add up Written by: Jordan Liles Dec. 1, 2025 Users sharing the rumor claimed the ""silent yet powerful act made social media explode."" Read More","About this rating A rumor that circulated online in late November 2025 claimed Taylor Swift and her fiance, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, donated $300,000 to save a 2-year-old (or a baby) with brain cancer. The matter further alleged the star couple announced an $80 million plan to build a free orphanage for children in need of housing. For example, on Nov. 29, a user managing a Facebook page named The News 247 posted (archived) the story with an image of Swift and Kelce appearing on Kelce's ""New Heights with Jason & Travis Kelce"" podcast, as well as a picture of a toddler in a hospital bed and a building displaying a sign reading, ""Taylor Swift Orphanage."" (The News 247/Facebook) The post, which claimed social media ""exploded"" at the alleged news and featured a comment leading to an advertisement-filled blog article, began as follows: BREAKING NEWS SHAKING AMERICA: TAYLOR SWIFT AND TRAVIS KELCE SPENT 300,000 USD TO FIGHT FOR THE LIFE OF A 2-YEAR-OLD BABY WITH ""BRAIN CANCER"" — AND ANNOUNCED THE PLAN TO BUILD THE LARGEST FREE ORPHANAGE IN THE UNITED STATES WORTH 80 MILLION USD. Not a stage, not an award show, not the dazzling lights of Hollywood — what silenced America today was the compassion of two people standing at the center of the world. Within 24 hours, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce quietly covered the entire 300,000 USD medical cost to save a 2-year-old girl battling brain cancer. That silent yet powerful act made social media explode, as millions witnessed a rare moment of kindness in a chaotic era. But the biggest shock was still to come. Immediately after the information was confirmed, the couple announced the plan to build the largest free orphanage in the United States, an 80-million-USD project for children without shelter and those in vulnerable situations. Not an empty promise — but a commitment, a concrete step toward real change. Other Facebook users shared the same rumor, including in a post (archived) on the Forever Folk Song Facebook page. A Snopes reader also asked via email about the matter. In short, the rumor about Swift and Kelce was false and featured text — both in the post and article — generated with artificial intelligence. Facebook's ""page transparency"" information for The News 247 (click ""News & media website,"" then ""Transparency and privacy policy"") and Forever Folk Song (click ""Fan page,"" then ""Transparency and privacy policy"") indicated their managers resided in Vietnam. The user or users behind the creation of the fabricated story sought to earn advertising revenue from readers clicking to read their blog articles. Snopes contacted the Wondery podcast company, which manages ""New Heights,"" by email to ask if Kelce wished to comment about this matter. We also reached out via email to a company associated with representing Swift to see if they would release a statement and will update this story if we receive further information. In April 2025, People.com reported Kelce appeared to deny on his podcast a similar rumor claiming he purchased a $3.3 million home and planned to turn it into a living facility for homeless youth. At the 1:14:34 mark in the April 9 episode, Kelce didn't mention the specific rumor but did say, ""This time I wasn't doing what was falsely claimed by the social channels or the outlets posting all this AI stuff."" He advised viewers to visit 87running.org to find authentic information about his charitable efforts. Whoever used an AI tool to generate the fabricated post and article possibly based the tale on a credibly reported story published by People.com and other outlets from October 2025, telling of how Swift — with no mention of Kelce — donated $100,000 to help the family of a 2-year-old toddler living with brain cancer. Additionally, in December 2024, USA Today reported Swift donated $250,000 to a Kansas City-based child-care organization to which Kelce previously donated his money and efforts. Searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo found no news media outlets credibly reporting any information about Swift and Kelce specifically donating $300,000 to a child cancer patient or planning an $80 million orphanage, or of social media ""exploding"" due to any such acts. Prominent outlets would have widely reported the rumor, if true. The end of the Facebook posts' text featured the same sort of dramatized, sometimes forward-thinking wording similar to the way AI tools conclude AI-generated text. That text read, ""Today, America isn't talking about hit songs or victories on the field. America is talking about compassion, about hope, and about a future where small, fragile children have the chance to live, to be loved, and to be protected."" Many other fabricated past rumors featuring AI-generated images and/or text claimed Swift and Kelce donated their money and/or their time to efforts surrounding the July 2025 Texas flash floods, an elderly couple who fostered children, victims in the Jeffrey Epstein case and the family of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. For further reading, Snopes previously reported on a false story claiming Kelce donated his ""entire"" $12.9 million in bonuses and endorsements to a homeless housing initiative. Longmire, Becca.

"Image claiming to show Melania Trump kissing Epstein on cheek isn't real Written by: Jordan Liles Dec. 1, 2025 Users shared the image with the sarcastic caption, ""What a travesty! Trying to say our First Lad ... Read More","About this rating In 2025, online users shared a rumor claiming a photo showed U.S. first lady Melania Trump kissing the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on his cheek. The image, which made the rounds in November 2025 following President Donald Trump's signing of a bill to release case files related to Epstein's sex crimes, had also been shared earlier in the year. For example, on Aug. 16, a Threads user posted (archived) the alleged picture with a sarcastic caption reading, ""What a travesty! Trying to say our First Lady had ANYTHING to do with this Epstein guy!"" The caption then featured a flushed face emoji, ending with, ""....never mind."" (@whiffney/Threads) Other users shared the purported photo, including posts with the same caption, on Bluesky (archived) Facebook (archived), Instagram (archived), Threads and X (archived). A Snopes reader also emailed us asking about the supposed picture, ""Is this a genuine photo of Melania Trump kissing Epstein?"" In short, the image was fake and generated with artificial intelligence. The aforementioned Threads user posted at least two other inauthentic (archived) pictures (archived) of Donald Trump, both of which we previously reported about. In the AI-generated photo of Melania Trump and Epstein, Epstein's facial features — in particular the size of his lips — did not match any authentic pictures of him. No news media outlets ever credibly reported the photo as being real. AI-detection tools including the AI or Not website and the University of Buffalo Media Forensics Lab's Deepfake-O-Meter both found mixed results when determining the picture's authenticity. The AI or Not website displayed a misleading result of ""likely real."" The Deepfake-O-Meter's detection models mostly wrongly found a low likelihood of AI. Tools that claim to detect AI in photos, text and videos often display unreliable results. On Aug. 12, the Lead Stories fact-checking website reported about the inauthentic nature of the same picture, tracing its roots from an August X post (archived) displaying a YouTube video thumbnail image. That YouTube video's title read, ""Trump GOES NUTS After Stephen Colbert AIRS Melania's UNSEEN Epstein Secrets On Live TV."" (@AnnieForTruth/X) As of December 2025, YouTube searches located no popular videos with the same title and thumbnail image, possibly indicating the user in control of the channel — or YouTube — removed the video or channel. One video with very few views displayed the same fake photo, while another video showed a similar AI-generated picture of the first lady kissing Epstein. For further reading, we previously reported about an authentic picture from 2000 showing Donald and the future first lady, then Melania Knauss, posing with Epstein and his confidant, convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as another photo of Trump and Knauss with Maxwell. We also published an article about a rumor that Melania Trump once modeled partially nude on an airplane owned by Epstein, as well as a claim she was an escort before meeting Donald Trump at a party hosted by Maxwell.
