Fake News Detector

Fake News Detector is a web-based Python application that identifies whether a news article or headline is real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It uses TF-IDF vectorization to represent text and a Logistic Regression model for classification. Built with Streamlit the app provides a simple and user-friendly interface to quickly check the credibility of news. This project is for academic purposes only.
