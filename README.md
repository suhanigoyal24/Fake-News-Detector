Fake News Detector with Streamlit

This Fake News Detector is a web-based application built with Python, Streamlit and Django that identifies whether a news article or headline is real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It uses TF-IDF vectorization for text representation and a Logistic Regression model for classification. The Streamlit frontend provides a simple and user-friendly interface to check news credibility, while the Django backend handles user reviews and stores data.
